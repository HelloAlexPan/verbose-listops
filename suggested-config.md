The primary goal of the Verbose ListOps benchmark is to create a significantly more challenging evaluation for Large Language Models (LLMs) compared to standard long-context retrieval tasks ("needle-in-a-haystack"). It aims to test an LLM's ability to perform complex, multi-step computational reasoning based on instructions and numerical data embedded within a long, potentially distracting, narrative context.

Key aspects highlighted:
*   **Core Task:** Uses the ListOps benchmark (hierarchical arithmetic/list operations) as the underlying computational problem.
*   **Challenge:** Embeds this task within an LLM-generated narrative, requiring the model to *extract* the operations and operands, *ignore* sophisticated narrative distractions (characters, plot, setting, specific padding), and *execute* the multi-step calculation correctly based on information scattered throughout the text.
*   **Target Application:** Simulates real-world tasks like extracting and scoring predictive signals (e.g., qualification signals in sales transcripts) from large amounts of unstructured text.
*   **Differentiation:** Unlike benchmarks focusing solely on finding facts (BABILong) or measuring degradation on known tasks with expanded context (LongReason), Verbose ListOps emphasizes *nested reasoning* and *extraction* within a *coherent, LLM-generated narrative* designed to include *plausible, contextually relevant distractions*.

**2. AI Abilities Tested by Verbose ListOps**

This evaluation specifically targets a combination of advanced AI capabilities:

1.  **Long-Context Processing & Understanding:** The ability to ingest, process, and maintain coherence over potentially very long sequences. *As SOTA models today cannot solve hard problems at even 10k token length, there is little utility in setting length longer than 10k. Save your tokens*.
2.  **Information Extraction:** Identifying and extracting specific numerical data (operands) and operational cues (keywords or descriptions related to MAX, MIN, MED, SUM, SM, AVG) from unstructured natural language.
3.  **Structured Reasoning & Problem Decomposition:** Reconstructing the implicit sequence and hierarchy of the ListOps operations from the narrative flow. The model needs to understand which numbers feed into which operation and in what order.
4.  **Computational Accuracy:** Correctly performing the specified arithmetic and list operations (Max, Min, Median, Sum, Sum Modulo 10, Average/Floor).
5.  **Distraction Resistance:** The crucial ability to differentiate between computationally relevant information (numbers, operational cues tied to the ListOps task) and irrelevant narrative elements (plot details, character dialogue, setting descriptions, explicit padding paragraphs). This tests robustness against sophisticated, contextually plausible noise.
6.  **Implicit Instruction Following:** Understanding the overall task (solve the embedded ListOps problem) based on the final prompt instructions, even when the steps themselves are described narratively rather than explicitly listed.

**3. Suggested Configurations for Difficulty Levels**

We can tune the difficulty by adjusting parameters that control the complexity of the ListOps task itself, the length and density of the narrative, and the amount of distraction.

Here are suggested configurations for Easy, Medium, and Hard levels, keeping the total token count below 10k:

**Level 1: Easy**

*   **Goal:** Test basic extraction and computation in a moderately long context with minimal distraction.
*   **Tested Abilities Focus:** Long-context processing (basic), Information Extraction, Simple Computation.
*   **Configuration:**
    ```python
    # --- Overall Context ---
    DEFAULT_MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS = 2000 # Shorter context
    MAX_TOKENS_BUFFER = 200

    # --- Narrative Generation ---
    DEFAULT_MAX_BEAT_TOKENS = 400  # Less verbose descriptions per step
    DEFAULT_MAX_PAD_TOKENS = 200   # Short padding sections
    # Implicit: max_pad_paragraphs = 0 or 1 (minimal padding between beats)

    # --- ListOps Task Complexity ---
    DEFAULT_MAX_OPS = 4          # Few operations, shallow hierarchy
    DEFAULT_MAX_BRANCH = 3       # Small number of operands per step
    MIN_ARITY = 2                # Basic operations
    ATOM_MIN_VALUE = 0           # Simple number range
    ATOM_MAX_VALUE = 9

    # --- Judge Prompt ---
    PROMPT_SHOT_COUNT = 3        # Provide maximum examples
    ```
*   **Rationale:** Short total length, few operations, simple operations (low arity/branching), simple numbers, minimal padding, and maximum few-shot guidance make it easier to identify and solve the core task.

**Level 2: Medium**

*   **Goal:** Test multi-step reasoning in a longer context with moderate, plausible distractions.
*   **Tested Abilities Focus:** Long-context processing (moderate), Structured Reasoning, Distraction Resistance (basic).
*   **Configuration:**
    ```python
    # --- Overall Context ---
    DEFAULT_MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS = 5000 # Medium context length
    MAX_TOKENS_BUFFER = 500

    # --- Narrative Generation ---
    DEFAULT_MAX_BEAT_TOKENS = 700  # More detailed narrative per step
    DEFAULT_MAX_PAD_TOKENS = 500   # More substantial padding
    # Implicit: max_pad_paragraphs = 1 or 2 (moderate padding between beats)

    # --- ListOps Task Complexity ---
    DEFAULT_MAX_OPS = 10         # Moderate number of operations
    DEFAULT_MAX_BRANCH = 5       # Moderate number of operands
    MIN_ARITY = 3                # Slightly more complex operations forced
    ATOM_MIN_VALUE = -10         # Slightly wider number range
    ATOM_MAX_VALUE = 10

    # --- Judge Prompt ---
    PROMPT_SHOT_COUNT = 1        # Provide minimal examples
    ```
*   **Rationale:** Increased context length, more operations requiring deeper reasoning, slightly more complex operations, more verbose beats and padding introduce more significant distractions. Reduced few-shot examples require better generalization.

**Level 3: Hard (Approaching the Stated SOTA Limit)**

*   **Goal:** Test complex, hierarchical reasoning in a very long context with significant, contextually relevant distractions and minimal guidance.
*   **Tested Abilities Focus:** Long-context processing (advanced), Hierarchical Computation, Distraction Resistance (advanced), Implicit Instruction Following.
*   **Configuration:**
    ```python
    # --- Overall Context ---
    DEFAULT_MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS = 9500 # Push close to the 10k limit
    MAX_TOKENS_BUFFER = 500         # Keep a reasonable buffer

    # --- Narrative Generation ---
    DEFAULT_MAX_BEAT_TOKENS = 1000 # Allow complex, subtle embedding within beats
    DEFAULT_MAX_PAD_TOKENS = 1000  # Maximize padding distraction length
    # Implicit: max_pad_paragraphs = 2 (maximum padding frequency allowed by code)

    # --- ListOps Task Complexity ---
    DEFAULT_MAX_OPS = 15         # Many operations, potentially deep hierarchy
                                 # (Adjust slightly lower if 10k tokens is consistently exceeded)
    DEFAULT_MAX_BRANCH = 8       # High number of operands per step
    MIN_ARITY = 4                # Force more complex operations
    ATOM_MIN_VALUE = -50         # Wider number range (less critical than structure)
    ATOM_MAX_VALUE = 50

    # --- Judge Prompt ---
    PROMPT_SHOT_COUNT = 0        # No examples, rely purely on instructions
    ```
*   **Rationale:** Pushes context length near the limit. Maximizes narrative complexity per step (`MAX_BEAT_TOKENS`) and distraction between steps (`MAX_PAD_TOKENS`, `max_pad_paragraphs=2`). Increases the number of operations (`MAX_OPS`) and their individual complexity (`MAX_BRANCH`, `MIN_ARITY`). Removing few-shot examples (`PROMPT_SHOT_COUNT=0`) forces the model to rely solely on its understanding of the narrative and the final instruction block. This configuration combines multiple difficulty levers simultaneously.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Token Counts:** The actual token count will vary based on the LLM's output for narrative generation. You might need to slightly adjust `DEFAULT_MAX_OPS` downwards in the Hard configuration if the combination of many beats, verbose beats, and heavy padding consistently exceeds `DEFAULT_MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS`.
*   **`max_pad_paragraphs`:** Remember that the number of padding paragraphs inserted between beats is controlled internally by the `generate_narrative` function (currently hardcoded up to `max_pad_paragraphs = 2`). This is a key driver of distraction, especially in the Hard setting.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Generate small batches with these settings and test them with your target SOTA models to confirm they align with the desired difficulty and stay within token limits before generating large datasets. You might find specific combinations are disproportionately hard or easy.
