Anya Volkov, arcane energies crackling around her fingertips, stood beside Jax, whose hawk-like eyes scanned the horizon, a sharp whistle escaping his lips. Elara Stormbright, gaze fixed on a distant cluster of stars, murmured what sounded like a celestial greeting.  Their adventure was about to begin.\n\nElara, guided by a whisper she claimed was from the constellation Cygnus, led them to three shimmering clusters of Skyfire Crystals. Anya, with a flick of her wrist, unearthed forty-three crystals from the first cluster, their facets glowing with an inner fire.  Jax, moving with his usual silent grace, uncovered ninety-four from a crevice hidden beneath a curtain of luminescent moss.  Finally, Elara, following the starlight, located ninety-seven more crystals nestled within the roots of a giant, glowing mushroom.  \"Fate's bounty, we combine as one,\" Anya declared, gathering the three caches together.  As the crystals touched, a low hum resonated through the air, and a spectral cipher appeared, shimmering above the combined pile.  It pulsed with light, then resolved into a single digit.  \"A trial of worth!\" Anya exclaimed, \"The Units Digit Cipher! It demands a sacrifice. We offer all but the final digit of our gathered sum.\"  With a sigh, she returned most of the crystals to their resting places, leaving them with only three.\n\nA thick mist, lavender-hued in the perpetual twilight, swirled around Anya's ankles as she closed the ancient chest.  The air crackled with lingering arcane energy, a faint scent of ozone tickling her nose.  Jax perched silently on a nearby crumbling pillar, a sleek raven mirroring his posture, while Elara gazed intently at a cluster of stars barely visible through the swirling mists.  A sense of anticipation hung heavy in the air.\n\nAnya Volkov, her arcane sigils glowing faintly beneath her cloak, whispered a brief incantation, the rhymes barely audible over the sigh of the wind.  Jax, perched atop a crumbling archway, mimicked the swirling mists with a graceful sweep of his hand, a silent question directed at Elara. The celestial navigator, her eyes fixed on a distant cluster of stars, nodded slowly, a flicker of understanding in her gaze. The air crackled with unspoken words and shared purpose.\n\nAnya, Jax, and Elara moved as one, drawn by an unseen force.  Before them shimmered three crystalline caverns, each pulsing with a soft, ethereal light.  Within the first swirled sixty-three Skyfire Crystals, their facets catching the dim light. The second cavern held ninety-six, a dazzling display of raw power. But the third, oh, the third â€“ it overflowed with ninety-nine Skyfire Crystals, a breathtaking spectacle of pure energy.  Elara, her eyes fixed on a particular constellation, pointed a trembling finger towards the third cavern.  Jax, with a series of swift hand gestures and a sharp bird call, confirmed her choice.  \"Aerilon's Apex Lode requires the largest bounty,\" Anya declared, her voice echoing through the caverns.  \"One path we choose, the others we must forsake. To the crystals of ninety-nine, our fate we now stake!\"\n\nAnya's spell faded, leaving a shimmering trail of amethyst smoke that curled around the swirling clouds below.  Jax, perched on the edge of their airship, ruffled his dark cloak and released a sharp, piercing whistle, as if confirming their course. Elara, her eyes reflecting the ethereal glow of the twilight sky, traced patterns amongst the stars with her fingertip, murmuring something about favorable celestial alignments. The airship dipped and swayed, catching a rogue gust of wind that carried the scent of blooming moon orchids.\n\nThe airship, a graceful vessel of polished mahogany and gleaming brass, creaked softly as it sailed through the lavender twilight.  Anya Volkov, her auburn braid trailing over her shoulder, leaned against the railing, inhaling the intoxicating fragrance of the moon orchids.  Somewhere below, hidden amongst the swirling mists that cloaked the lower islands, Jax gestured emphatically, a sharp whistle escaping his lips. Elara, eyes fixed on a distant constellation, murmured something about favorable celestial alignments.\n\nElara, eyes fixed on a distant constellation, murmured something about favorable celestial alignments.  \"The Apex Lode,\" she declared, \"reveals its bounty only to those who seek the greatest prize.\"  Jax, with 4 swift hand gestures, pointed to 1 shimmering cave entrance after another. Anya, deciphering his silent language, explained, \"Jax has located four potential crystal caches.\" The first cave shimmered with an inner light suggesting twenty-two Skyfire Crystals. The second held a stronger glow, hinting at fifty-three.  The third pulsed with an intense luminescence, indicating eighty-six crystals within. The final cave radiated an almost blinding light, promising eighty-seven Skyfire Crystals.  \"Aerilon's Apex Lode demands we choose wisely,\" Anya reminded them.  Focusing on the cave radiating the most intense light, she proclaimed, \"The greatest bounty calls to us!  Eighty-seven it is!\"\n\nA cool breeze swept across the archipelago, carrying the scent of blooming sky orchids and the faint, metallic tang of the storm clouds gathering on the horizon.  Jax, perched atop a crumbling watchtower, ruffled his dark cloak and released a sharp, piercing whistle, a sound that echoed across the chasm separating their island from the glowing spire Elara had indicated. Anya, ever practical, adjusted the straps of her spell-casting satchel, a wry smile playing on her lips.  The lure of adventure, it seemed, was as intoxicating as ever.\n\nA cool, lavender-tinged breeze swept across the archipelago, carrying the scent of blooming moon orchids and the distant, echoing cry of a skywhale. Anya tucked a loose strand of auburn hair behind her ear, her emerald eyes gleaming with anticipation.  Jax, perched silently on a nearby railing, mimicked the whale's call with a series of sharp whistles, a gesture Anya interpreted as agreement.  Elara, ever attuned to the celestial tapestry above, pointed towards a particularly bright cluster of stars, murmuring something about favorable winds.\n\nElara Stormbright, guided by a particularly bright cluster of stars, led Anya and Jax to four distinct shimmering groves.  Within the first, they discovered forty-three Skyfire Crystals pulsating with celestial energy.  The second grove yielded fifty-seven crystals, their facets catching the ethereal twilight.  Anya, chanting a rhyming couplet, coaxed sixty Skyfire Crystals from the third grove, their light swirling around her like captured stardust.  Jax, with a series of swift hand gestures and a sharp bird call, uncovered a final cache of ninety-four crystals hidden beneath a gnarled root in the fourth grove.  Anya, carefully gathering the newly discovered crystals, combined them with the existing Skyfire Crystals representing their Apex Lode Claim.  \"One grand sum, our path will become!\" she declared, holding aloft the unified collection, now brimming with the sum of all their crystalline bounty.\n\nA soft cerulean glow emanated from the unified crystals, bathing Anya, Jax, and Elara in its ethereal light.  A cool breeze, scented with the strange, sweet flora of Aerilon, swept through the ruins where they stood.  Jax, ever vigilant, scanned the horizon, his hawk-like gaze piercing the perpetual twilight. Elara tilted her head back, her silver hair shimmering, murmuring something about a particularly auspicious alignment of stars. Anya, still clutching the unified crystals, felt a thrill course through her, a sense of accomplishment mixed with a growing anticipation of what lay ahead.\n\nA gentle breeze, tinged with the scent of blooming sky orchids, swept across the platform. Anya tucked a loose strand of auburn hair behind her ear, her emerald eyes scanning the swirling lavender clouds that enveloped the islands.  Jax perched on the edge of the platform, a silent silhouette against the twilight sky, his falcon, Zephyr, mirroring his posture. Elara, ever attuned to the celestial tapestry above, traced patterns in the air with her finger, seemingly lost in conversation with the distant, shimmering stars.\n\nElara, finished communing with the constellations, pointed a finger towards four distinct shimmering lights dancing on the horizon. \"The Apex Balancing Stone reveals its whims,\" she declared, \"four paths, each a test of fate's decree.\" Anya, ever the pragmatist, translated Elara's cryptic pronouncements. \"Four caches of Skyfire Crystals, she means. One holds forty-two, another seventy-four, a third with seventy-eight, and the last boasts ninety-two.\" Jax, with a series of swift hand gestures and a sharp bird call, indicated they should investigate.  Each cache, shimmering with an ethereal light, materialized before them.  Elara, consulting her star charts once more, announced, \"The Apex Claim, balanced it must be. Not the least, not the greatest, but the heart of the bounty we must seize.\"  Anya nodded, \"The median, she means.  Between these four caches, we must choose the one with the middle value.\" After a moment of consideration, Anya pointed towards the cache of seventy-eight crystals. \"This one,\" she declared, \"resonates with the Apex Balancing Stone's decree.  Seventy-four and seventy-eight, the heart of the bounty, it must be!\"  They carefully collected the crystals, leaving the other caches untouched.\n\n---\n\n**Question:** Following the entire sequence of events described in the story, exactly how many Skyfire Crystals did the characters end up with?
