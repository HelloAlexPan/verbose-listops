Far below, the world was a swirling abyss of mist and shadow.\n\nA small figure, cloaked and agile, moved with practiced silence along the bridge's crumbling edge. Lyra Swiftwing, her halfling form a part of the deepening gloom, paused near a weathered parapet. Her sharp eyes scanned the distant island, its peaks crowned with the skeletal remains of structures that predated memory. Something pulsed there, a faint, ethereal light visible only to those who knew where to look. A Celestial Orb.\n\nAnother shadow detached itself from the very air behind her. Taller, leaner, with a subtle, non-human grace. Anya Shadowwalker, the tiefling assassin, her gaze intense even in the low light.\n\n\"It's there,\" Lyra murmured, not turning.\n\n\"I know,\" Anya's voice was low, a rasp of dry leaves. \"Getting to it will be... challenging. The guardians are restless. And the darkness gathers.\"\n\nShe gestured towards the horizon, where an unnatural inkiness seemed to devour the stars before they could even fully emerge. This was the returning tide they feared. The Orbs were the only hope, the legends whispered, but finding them was a perilous quest. And this particular Orb... it held a power unlike the others. A power that could tip the balance.\n\nLyra tightened her grip on the small pack slung across her shoulder. \"Challenging is my favorite kind of job.\"\n\nAnya gave a faint, almost imperceptible nod. Their paths had converged for this purpose, drawn by the same desperate need, the same dangerous secret. The Orb awaited. And the night was vast.\n\n...And the night was vast.\nThey moved like wraiths through the skeletal remains of the sky-city, guided by instinct and faint, resonant hum. The air grew colder, charged with ancient power. Their quarry, the Orb, was close, but the path was littered with remnants of its kind. Lyra pointed towards a cracked pedestal half-buried in rubble. In it lay **eight** Celestial Orbs, their light muted but steady. Anya nodded, her eyes scanning the crumbling structure above. Embedded in the stone wall were **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, glowing faintly, clinging to the precipice.\nThey scaled the broken masonry, the wind whipping around them. Across a narrow, precarious bridge, a small niche offered refuge, and within it rested **sixteen** Celestial Orbs, radiating a soft warmth. Descending into a shadowed chamber, the floor was scattered with **fifteen** Celestial Orbs, like fallen stars. Anya found a hidden compartment behind a loose panel; it contained **twenty** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces surprisingly smooth.\nThey navigated winding tunnels beneath the city's foundation. Deep within, a damp recess revealed **nine** Celestial Orbs clustered together, their hum a low thrum against the stone. Emerging into a larger cavern, they saw, arranged in a complex, forgotten pattern in the center, **twenty-three** Celestial Orbs, pulsing in unison. Closer to their ultimate destination, nestled near the entrance to the inner sanctum, a final cluster of **eighteen** Celestial Orbs pulsed with an undeniable, unified light.\nAs they observed these varied collections, a realization dawned. It wasn't just the quantity of Orbs, but a shared quality, an underlying vibration, a core luminescence that seemed consistent regardless of the size of the cluster or its location. It was the heart of their power, the fundamental spark. This, Lyra thought, feeling the resonance in her bones, this must be it. The Celestial Essence.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe hum of the Orbs faded slightly, leaving a profound silence in the ancient stone chamber. Lyra felt the truth of their discovery settle deep within her, a resonance that echoed the faint pulse of the Essence. The air hung heavy with the weight of forgotten ages, the scent of damp earth and old magic clinging to the shadows. Anya stood beside her, her gaze fixed on the dark opening that promised the heart of the ruins. The path forward beckoned, fraught with the unknown, yet illuminated by the understanding they had just found.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe silence that followed the Orbs' song was profound, a heavy cloak draped over the stone. Dust motes danced in the faint light filtering from above, swirling around the ancient carvings that adorned the walls. Lyra pressed a hand to the cool stone, feeling the deep thrum of the earth beneath the ruin. Anya turned from the dark passage, her eyes reflecting the dim glow, a mixture of resolve and apprehension etched upon her face. The air grew colder as they contemplated the unknown depths ahead, the scent of damp stone and forgotten secrets beckoning them deeper into the heart of the mountain. A breath held, a threshold crossed, was all that lay between them and whatever awaited in the darkness.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nAnya took the step, her form swallowed by the encroaching gloom of the passage. Lyra followed, the faint light from the chamber behind them shrinking to nothing as they moved deeper. The air here was different, colder still, carrying a faint, unsettling hum that seemed to vibrate in their teeth. The walls pressed close, slick with dampness, the stone rough beneath their fingertips as they occasionally brushed against it for guidance. Silence reigned, a heavy blanket muffling even the sound of their own footsteps, amplifying the beat of their hearts in their ears. Ahead, the darkness was absolute, a tangible presence that promised both revelation and peril in equal measure. They walked into the mountain's embrace, leaving the echoes of the Orbs' song far behind.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey moved deeper into the mountain's throat, the passage walls slick and cold against their occasional touch. The air hung stagnant, carrying the faint, metallic tang of deep earth and something else, something ancient and undisturbed. The unsettling hum persisted, a low vibration that seemed to originate from the very stone around them, a silent song only their bones could hear. Lyra kept close behind Anya, the rustle of their cloaks the only sound besides their own careful breathing and the distant, rhythmic drip of water echoing from somewhere unseen ahead. The darkness was absolute, a heavy cloak that pressed in from all sides, demanding trust in touch and instinct alone. Each step was a venture into the unknown, leaving the world above and its familiar light further behind with every measured pace.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air grew heavier, thick with the scent of damp stone and forgotten time. Their hands brushed against the rough, unyielding rock face, cool and damp beneath their touch. Silence pressed in, broken only by their own measured breaths and the distant, persistent chime of water finding its way through the living rock. Each step felt deliberate, a commitment deeper into the mountain's heart, where the sun's light had never reached. The darkness was a palpable presence, a blindfold demanding faith in the feel of the ground and the sound of their companion's movement close behind. They moved as shadows within shadows, drawn onward by the faint, resonant hum that seemed to guide them deeper into the earth's silent, ancient core.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe air grew heavier, thick with the scent of damp stone and forgotten time.

The darkness was a palpable presence, a blindfold demanding faith in the feel of the ground and the sound of their companion's movement close behind. They moved as shadows within shadows, drawn onward by the faint, resonant hum that seemed to guide them deeper into the earth's silent, ancient core.\n\nRounding a bend, they found a small fissure barely wide enough to peer into. Within, nestled on a ledge, were two Celestial Orbs, their light a faint pulse against the dark. Further down the passage, the air grew warmer, and they discovered a cluster of four Orbs embedded in the cavern wall, their glow steady and calm. The path opened into a vast, echoing chamber where a subterranean stream flowed. Submerged just beneath the surface, they saw seven Orbs, their radiance diffused by the water.\n\nContinuing their descent, they navigated treacherous ledges and narrow tunnels. In a hidden alcove, shielded by a curtain of rock, fifteen Orbs pulsed with a soft, rhythmic light, unlike the others. Deeper still, the hum intensified. They entered a wide grotto, and there, resting on a pedestal of natural stone, was a striking collection of twenty-five Orbs, their combined light casting dancing shadows across the rough-hewn walls.\n\nFinally, they reached the heart of the mountain, a vast, silent cathedral of stone. And there, filling a massive hollow, was the source of the hum, a breathtaking assembly of thirty Celestial Orbs, their light a powerful, almost overwhelming beacon. Comparing the energy emanating from this immense find to the faint echo of The Celestial Essence they carried, or the distinct pulses from the smaller caches, it was clear which held the greatest potential. This unparalleled concentration, radiating pure, untamed power, was recognized instantly as something new, something ultimate. They designated this profound discovery, this apex of power deep within the earth, as The Celestial Prime.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air in the vast chamber pulsed with a light that was more than mere illumination; it was a palpable presence, warm and vital, filling the immense space from floor to towering ceiling. Dust motes danced in the radiance, swirling like golden snow in the silent air. The stone walls, rough-hewn and ancient, seemed to absorb and reflect the energy, creating dancing shadows that shifted with the Orbs' steady thrum. A deep sense of awe settled over the companions, the journey's fatigue momentarily forgotten in the face of such raw, untamed power. The silence, broken only by the deep resonance, felt ancient and profound, holding the weight of ages within its stillness.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe pervasive light warmed their skin, a gentle pressure that seemed to resonate within their very core. It carried the weight of ages, a silent hum that spoke of power beyond mortal reckoning. Elara extended a hand slowly into the glowing air, her fingers trembling with the sheer intensity of the energy. Beside her, Kaelen watched the radiant source, his face a mask of silent reverence. Borin let out a low sound, a rumble of awe that acknowledged the raw force filling the space. They exchanged glances, a shared understanding passing between them without a word, a mutual recognition of the profound mystery that enveloped them. The golden dust continued its slow, mesmerizing swirl, caught forever in the heart of the timeless glow.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe pervasive light deepened, shifting from gold to a richer, warmer hue that pulsed gently, like a colossal heart beating in the stillness. It painted long, stretching shadows that danced and writhed along unseen surfaces, hinting at forms just beyond comprehension. Elara opened her eyes, the light no longer just external but seeming to fill her vision from within, illuminating thoughts she hadn't known she possessed. Kaelen reached out, not to touch the light directly, but to feel the warmth radiating from the air around it, a silent acknowledgment of its power. Borin let out a soft sigh, the sound lost almost instantly in the profound silence, a silence that wasn't empty but full of the ancient hum. They stood bathed in the glow, figures etched against eternity, bound together by the shared experience of the impossible.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe profound radiance began to recede, not abruptly, but like a slow, deep breath being exhaled by the world itself. The vibrant pulse softened, the light withdrawing its intense embrace, leaving behind an air that felt both cleansed and heavy with memory. The long shadows, which had danced with impossible life, settled back into their familiar, static forms, though they seemed deeper now, holding secrets whispered by the departed glow.\n\nA different silence descended, not the expectant hush that preceded the light, but a resonant quiet, filled with the echo of immense power. Borin let out a slow breath, the sound loud in the sudden stillness. Kaelen’s hand, which had reached towards the warmth, lowered slowly, his fingers flexing as if grasping something invisible. Elara blinked, the afterimage of the brilliant hue lingering behind her eyes, painting the dimming surroundings with ethereal strokes. They stood, figures etched against the returning gloom, bound by the unspoken understanding of having witnessed something truly beyond the veil. The stone beneath their feet felt solid once more, a grounding anchor after moments adrift in the infinite.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow. Borin shifted his weight, the leather of his armor creaking softly, his gaze sweeping the now-dim chamber as if searching for echoes of the departed radiance. Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep. They stood there for a time, letting the world settle, letting their own hearts find a steady rhythm again, the cool, real stone beneath their boots a welcome anchor.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nSlowly, they began to move, their boots crunching on fallen stone dust. The chamber was vast, its edges lost in shadow, but littered with the debris of ages. They split up, flash-lamps cutting swathes through the gloom, searching for anything missed in the initial chaos. Borin found a cluster first, nestled in a cracked pedestal – a small cache of Celestial Orbs, numbering just **four**. Further along, near a collapsed archway, Kaelen unearthed a sealed lead box containing a larger collection – **twenty-one** of the glowing spheres. Elara, exploring a niche behind a crumbling statue, discovered a tightly packed grouping – precisely **six** Celestial Orbs. Deep within a narrow fissure, Borin called out again, having found another, distinct pocket – another **six** of the shimmering orbs. Kaelen then located a scattered trail leading to a hidden cavity; within lay **seven** Celestial Orbs, pulsing faintly. Finally, Elara found a large, ornate chest, mostly buried, which held a significant hoard – **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, their light muted by the ancient wood.\n\nThey gathered the discovered orbs, placing them carefully on a flat stone surface, the different quantities laid out before them. The light they cast was varied, some bright, others dim. They looked at the disparate piles, considering their meaning. They also remembered the power of **The Celestial Prime**, the immense energy they had just witnessed, a force that felt like a cornerstone to all these smaller findings.\n\n\"So many,\" Borin murmured, gesturing at the collections.\n\nKaelen knelt, his fingers hovering over the different groups. \"We have these... and the echoes of **The Celestial Prime**.\" His gaze settled on that particular group. \"Look at these,\" he said softly. \"Compared to the others, this group seems... centered. Balanced. Not the fewest, not the most, not clustered with the others of similar count. They feel like the pivot point, the still eye in the storm of all this rediscovered power.\"\n\nElara nodded slowly, her eyes fixed on the group Kaelen indicated. \"Yes,\" she breathed. \"The axis around which the others might turn. The core frequency.\"\n\nKaelen carefully picked up a single orb from that specific group, its light steady and calm. \"This group,\" he declared, holding the orb aloft, \"this is the **Celestial Axis**.\"\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe cavern air settled around them, thick with the scent of ancient dust and the faint, metallic tang of power. The collected orbs lay upon the stone, their individual lights weaving a tapestry of soft, shifting hues across the rough walls. Elara felt the quiet hum emanating from the stones, a resonance that seemed to echo the vast, formless energy they had encountered before. Borin ran a hand over the cool, damp rock face nearby, his thoughts seemingly lost in the deep quiet of the earth. Kaelen still held the orb designated as the Axis, its steady glow a calm point amidst the others. A profound stillness descended, broken only by the subtle whisper of air currents deep within the subterranean passages. They remained there for a long moment, absorbing the significance of their find, the weight of potential hanging palpable in the air.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air in the cavern remained heavy, thick with the scent of the deep earth and the faint, almost sweet perfume of raw power. The collected lights from the orbs pulsed softly, painting the rough-hewn walls with shifting hues of gold, sapphire, and emerald. Elara closed her eyes for a breath, feeling the deep resonance within her bones, a silent echo of the vast energies they had touched. It was a connection both ancient and new, a thread woven between her spirit and the heart of the world. Borin finally lowered his hand from the damp stone, his gaze sweeping across the array of glowing spheres, a quiet contemplation etched upon his face. Kaelen shifted his weight slightly, the weight of the Axis orb in his hand a steady anchor in the profound stillness. Outside the immediate pool of light, shadows clung to the cavern's edges, vast and impenetrable, hinting at the paths yet untrodden and the secrets still held within the earth's embrace. A subtle chill seemed to creep into the air, a silent signal that the moment of quiet reflection must soon give way to the next step.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey turned their backs on the fading glow, the vibrant hues retreating as they moved towards the cavern's edge. A deeper darkness awaited, a silent, absolute void that seemed to press in from the surrounding gloom. The air grew noticeably cooler, carrying the sharp tang of mineral and the faint, earthy smell of undisturbed stone. Borin raised his lantern, its beam cutting a hesitant path into the gloom. Kaelen adjusted his grip on the weight he carried, his steps steady despite the uncertainty ahead. Elara felt the shift in the earth's energy, the powerful resonance of the chamber left behind replaced by a quiet, ancient stillness that settled deep within her bones. They stepped forward, leaving the pool of light, trusting the unseen path to guide them deeper into the mountain's heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe vibrant light of the chamber receded entirely, leaving them enveloped in a profound, echoing darkness. Borin’s lantern cast a small, trembling circle of illumination that seemed only to emphasize the vastness of the void beyond its reach. The air grew heavier, thick with the scent of damp earth and ancient stone, carrying a silence so complete it felt like a physical weight. Kaelen shifted the burden he carried, the faint scrape of material against his shoulder a jarring sound in the stillness. Elara closed her eyes for a moment, letting the mountain’s deep, resonant quiet flow through her, a stark contrast to the vibrant energy left behind. They moved forward deliberately, trusting their senses and the faint, unseen path beneath their feet, deeper into the mountain’s unyielding heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark. Each step echoed softly in the vast quiet, swallowed almost instantly by the stone. Borin kept the light low and steady, his gaze fixed on the ground just ahead. Kaelen shifted his burden, the familiar weight a small comfort in the overwhelming unknown. Elara trailed a hand along the damp, rough-hewn wall beside her, feeling the mountain's immense, silent presence. The air grew heavy with the scent of deep earth and something else, something ancient and undisturbed. A profound stillness settled around them, broken only by the faint, rhythmic sound of their own passage, drawing them further into the mountain's unyielding heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe air grew heavy with the scent of deep earth and something else, something ancient and undisturbed. A profound stillness settled around them, broken only by the faint, rhythmic sound of their own passage, drawing them further into the mountain's unyielding heart.\n\nThey followed a narrow, winding passage that opened into a vast cavern, its ceiling lost in shadow. Around the cavern's edge, in scattered depressions and on rocky shelves, lay the objects of their quest. Borin raised the lantern, its beam sweeping across the space.\n\n\"Look,\" Elara whispered, pointing. In a shallow depression near the entrance lay a small cluster of **two** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces gleaming faintly even in the low light. Further along, on a jagged ledge, was a slightly larger grouping of **four**. Kaelen moved carefully towards a wider alcove, finding a scattered collection of **eight** Celestial Orbs spread across the dusty floor.\n\nTheir search continued, revealing more. Within a crumbling section of the far wall, they uncovered a discovery of **seventeen** Celestial Orbs, nestled together as if hidden deliberately long ago. Deeper in the cavern, near a pool of still, dark water, they found a significant deposit of **twenty-eight** Celestial Orbs, their combined glow casting an ethereal light. Moving into a side chamber they hadn't noticed before, Borin's lantern illuminated a second, equally large hoard of **twenty-eight** Celestial Orbs, filling a natural basin in the rock. Elara's breath hitched as she spotted an impressive cache holding **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs tucked beneath a rocky overhang.\n\nThey surveyed the different findings. Compared to the lesser quantities, these larger concentrations pulsed with undeniable power, dwarfing even the memory of the **Celestial Axis**. The energy radiating from the most potent of these caches was overwhelming, a clear focal point among all they had uncovered. This preeminent quantity, this heart of power they had sought, was clearly paramount. They knew this was it. This was the source they would henceforth refer to as **The Star's Eye**.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nA profound silence settled upon the cavern, broken only by the faint, resonant hum emanating from the heart of their discovery. The air itself seemed to thicken, heavy with the weight of ancient power. Kaelen knelt near the radiant cache, his fingers tracing patterns on the cool stone floor, lost in contemplation. Borin held his lantern aloft, its mundane glow paling against the ethereal light of The Star's Eye, a look of weary wonder etched upon his face. Elara simply stood, her breath held captive, her gaze fixed upon the pulsing energy, a deep and abiding sense of awe washing over her. Around them, the shadows deepened, the cavern walls seeming to lean in, guardians of this potent secret.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe profound silence held them captive, punctuated only by the deep, resonant hum that seemed to vibrate in their very bones. The air grew heavier still, thick with the scent of damp earth and something else, something ancient and potent. Elara felt the cavern walls pressing in, not with malice, but with the quiet watchfulness of ages. The ethereal light of the artifact pulsed steadily, casting dancing shadows that seemed to whisper secrets only the stone remembered. Borin shifted slightly, his joints protesting the long journey, but his gaze remained fixed on the radiant energy, his weariness momentarily forgotten in the face of such impossible beauty. Kaelen remained lost in thought, his fingers still tracing invisible patterns on the cool floor, a silent figure against the backdrop of the otherworldly glow. Time seemed to stretch and warp in this hidden place, measured only by the steady thrum of the power they had unearthed.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe deep hum resonated not just in their bones, but in the very air surrounding them. Elara felt the cavern breathe, a slow, ancient inhalation and exhalation against her skin. The scent of damp earth mingled with the sharp, clean energy of the artifact, a strange perfume of deep time and potent magic. Borin shifted again, a low groan escaping him, yet his eyes remained fixed on the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent awe etched upon his face. Kaelen rose slowly, his movements deliberate, his gaze sweeping across the dancing shadows as if searching for answers hidden within the shifting light. The silence, profound and watchful, seemed to hold its breath alongside them.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air thrummed with a low, resonant energy that seemed to seep into their very bones. Shadows stretched and writhed across the uneven stone, cast by the artifact's persistent glow. A scent, earthy and sharp, filled the space, a perfume of deep time and potent power. Elara felt the cavern breathe around them, a slow, steady pulse against her skin. Borin shifted, a soft sound escaping him, his gaze still held by the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent wonder etched upon his face. Kaelen stood, his movements deliberate, his eyes sweeping the dancing darkness as if seeking secrets hidden within the shifting light. The silence that enveloped them was profound, watchful, holding its breath alongside their own.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe heavy air pressed in, thick with the scent of ancient stone and something else, something wild and untamed. Elara closed her eyes for a moment, letting the cavern's pulse resonate through her, a deep, slow beat that felt older than time itself. Borin sighed softly beside her, a sound lost almost instantly in the profound quiet, his gaze still fixed on the source of the light, a silent reverence in his posture. Kaelen remained a still, watchful presence, his attention sharp, scanning the edges of the chamber where the light failed and the true darkness began. Each breath they took felt deliberate, loud in the stillness, a fragile counterpoint to the immense, silent power that filled the space. The shadows danced, not randomly, but with a strange, almost purposeful grace, as if they were living things, observing them in turn. A chill, not of cold but of immense age, settled upon their skin. The silence deepened, becoming a tangible weight, pressing upon their thoughts, urging them to simply *be* in the presence of something vast and unknowable.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe silence deepened, becoming a tangible weight, pressing upon their thoughts, urging them to simply *be* in the presence of something vast and unknowable. Elara broke the spell, her voice a low murmur. \"We must gather them. All of them.\" She gestured towards the glowing core of the chamber, where the energy of 'The Star's Eye' pulsed. Carefully, reverently, they began the process. From a hidden niche in the rock face, Borin retrieved a cluster of **eight** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces cool despite the ambient warmth. Kaelen, examining a crystalline growth near the chamber's edge, discovered a vein containing **ten** more, embedded like luminous jewels. Elara herself located a small, intricately carved box holding **nine** orbs, their light muted but steady. Deeper within the chamber, almost hidden by shadow, lay a larger cache – a spill of **twenty-four** orbs, scattered across a natural pedestal. Finally, tucked into a high, narrow fissure, they found another group of **nine** orbs, nestled together.\n\nAs each quantity was added to the area around 'The Star's Eye', the chamber's resonance intensified. The individual lights merged, swirling into a single, blinding vortex of energy. It didn't simply grow brighter; it began to cycle, to pulse with an intricate, internal rhythm. Elara raised the focusing crystal, directing the chaotic energy onto a flat, ancient stone. The light settled, forming a dynamic pattern that shifted and reformed continuously. It was a complex, fluid dance, a visual representation of the energy's core nature. Kaelen leaned closer, his eyes sharp. \"Look,\" he said, pointing. \"The fundamental pattern, the repeating core essence... it reveals itself in the cycle.\" Borin nodded slowly, a look of profound understanding dawning on his face. This repeating sequence, this fundamental rhythm, this was the essence they sought. This was the heart of the chamber's power. This, they knew, was 'The Celestial Key'.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe vibrant energy subsided, leaving behind a profound stillness in the ancient chamber. The complex pattern pulsed softly on the stone, a quiet echo of the power that had flowed through the air moments ago. Kaelen ran a hand through his hair, his eyes still adjusting from the brilliance. Elara carefully placed the focusing crystal onto a nearby ledge, her fingers lingering on its smooth surface. Borin let out a slow breath, the tension easing from his shoulders, replaced by a deep, quiet understanding. The air felt different now, charged with the weight of their discovery and the silent promise of the path that lay ahead. They had found the key, its essence captured, but the lock it would open remained a mystery waiting in the shadows.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nA profound silence descended upon the ancient space, broken only by the soft echo of their own breathing. Dust motes danced in a shaft of light piercing the gloom from a high vent. Kaelen met Elara's gaze across the pulsing symbol, a silent acknowledgement passing between them – the weight of their accomplishment mingling with the daunting uncertainty of what lay beyond this threshold. Borin rested a hand on the cool, worn stone of the wall, feeling the deep history embedded there, a history that now intertwined with their own fate. The air, thick with residual power, seemed to hum with unspoken questions, hinting at trials yet to face, secrets yet to unravel, and a destiny that felt both near and impossibly distant. They lingered in the quiet, absorbing the moment before the world outside the chamber reclaimed them.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe profound silence held them, a heavy cloak woven from ancient stone and residual power. Dust motes continued their slow, silent ballet in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom. Kaelen finally turned from the fading luminescence of the symbol, his eyes scanning the shadowed passage that beckoned them onward. Elara moved to his side, her touch lingering on the cool air where the energy had thrummed moments before. Borin pushed away from the wall, a deep breath escaping him, the sound soft in the stillness. They left the heart of the chamber, stepping back into the less charged air of the corridor, the weight of their accomplishment and the daunting unknown ahead settling upon them like a physical mantle as they faced the path forward.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey moved deeper into the passage, leaving the charged air of the chamber behind. The corridor walls were rough-hewn stone, slick with ancient damp, and the air grew cooler, carrying the faint, earthy scent of deep places. Shadows stretched and danced ahead of them, swallowing the meager light cast by Kaelen's lamp. Elara kept close, her hand occasionally brushing against his arm, a silent anchor in the encroaching gloom. Borin's heavy steps echoed softly, a steady rhythm against the silence that pressed in from all sides. The path twisted and turned, each bend revealing only more stone, more shadow, a relentless descent into the earth's forgotten heart. Uncertainty settled upon them, a quiet weight accompanying their weary steps.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe passage continued its relentless descent, the rough-hewn walls slick with perpetual dampness. The air grew colder still, thick with the earthy smell of deep stone and unseen water. Kaelen's lamp cast a meager pool of light that struggled against the encroaching shadow, illuminating only a few paces ahead before the darkness swallowed everything. Elara stayed close, her hand occasionally finding his arm, a silent reassurance in the oppressive quiet. Borin's heavy tread echoed steadily behind them, a constant presence against the silence that pressed in from all sides. Each turn revealed only more of the same – the endless stone, the creeping gloom, the slow, wearying journey into the earth's embrace. A profound sense of isolation settled upon them, a quiet understanding that they were far removed from the world above, lost in the labyrinthine depths.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air grew heavy and still, carrying the chill of ages past. Kaelen's lamp cast only a small, flickering circle of defiance against the absolute blackness that pressed in from all sides, revealing nothing but the same slick, unyielding stone. The silence here was not an absence of sound, but a tangible presence, broken only by the soft scrape of their boots and the steady rhythm of their breathing. Elara's hand remained a quiet comfort on his arm, a warm point in the pervasive cold. Behind them, Borin's solid form was a bulwark against the encroaching dark, his presence a quiet strength. They moved as a single entity through the deep, the world above feeling impossibly distant, utterly forgotten in the profound, ancient quiet of the earth's heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n...The air grew heavy and still, carrying the chill of ages past.

Ahead, the passage widened into a series of small alcoves carved into the living rock. Within the first, nestled on a shelf of crystal, pulsed the soft light of **five** Celestial Orbs. They moved to the next, where a different arrangement of **eight** Celestial Orbs rested in a shallow basin of water that mirrored their glow. Further in, a deeper recess held a cluster of **nineteen** Celestial Orbs, their combined light creating a gentle warmth in the cool air. Across the way, suspended in a web of fine, metallic threads, hung **twenty-two** Celestial Orbs, shimmering like captured stars. Finally, the largest alcove opened into a small grotto, and there, filling the space with an intense, vibrant radiance, lay **twenty-eight** Celestial Orbs, their energy palpable even from a distance.\n\nThey stood before the collection of discoveries, their eyes drawn inevitably to the grotto. The power emanating from that final, largest group was undeniable, dwarfing the energies of the others. Kaelen stepped forward, his lamp now unnecessary in the face of the Orbs' brilliance. \"Look,\" he breathed, his voice echoing slightly in the space. \"Compared to this, even The Celestial Key feels like a whisper against a storm.\" Elara nodded, her gaze fixed on the radiant cluster. \"This concentration... this is the heartwood we sought.\" Borin placed a hand on Kaelen's shoulder, his voice low and resonant. \"This is the culmination. This supreme quantity... we shall name it The Aetherial Prime.\"\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air in the grotto thrummed with the concentrated energy of the orbs. Their combined radiance painted the rock walls in shifting hues of gold and sapphire, chasing away the last vestiges of shadow. A profound sense of awe settled upon the companions, a quiet reverence for the sheer power gathered in this hidden place. Kaelen reached out a hand, not touching, but feeling the warmth that emanated from the glowing cluster, a warmth that seemed to resonate deep within his bones. Elara closed her eyes for a moment, breathing in the charged air, a faint smile touching her lips as she felt the truth of their quest settle upon her like a mantle. Borin stood silent, his gaze steady, a flicker of ancient understanding in his eyes as he witnessed the heartwood of this place unveiled. The weight of their journey, the trials faced, the paths taken – all seemed to converge here, in the luminous presence of the Aetherial Prime.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe luminous presence of the Aetherial Prime bathed the grotto in an ethereal glow. The light, a blend of molten gold and deep ocean sapphire, danced across the uneven rock faces, revealing hidden facets and veins of glittering stone. The air itself felt alive, thick with a resonant energy that hummed against the skin like a gentle vibration. A profound stillness settled upon the companions, a quiet reverence that transcended spoken words. They simply stood, breathing in the charged atmosphere, letting the ancient power seep into their weary bones. The warmth emanating from the glowing cluster was not merely heat, but a deep, pervasive feeling of connection, a sense of being anchored to the very heart of the world. Shadows clung only to the deepest recesses, pushed back by the overwhelming radiance that filled the cavern, leaving no corner untouched by its transformative light.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe vibrant pulse of the Aetherial Prime gradually subsided, leaving behind a profound stillness that felt heavier than silence. The light, though diminished from its peak intensity, still painted the cavern walls with hues of twilight and dawn, its gentle glow revealing the intricate patterns etched into the ancient stone. The air, no longer vibrating with raw power, held a crisp, clean quality, carrying the faint scent of damp earth and something else, something akin to pure starlight. A deep, pervasive sense of peace settled over the weary travelers, a quiet contentment that seeped into their bones and eased the tension from their shoulders. They lingered in the luminous afterglow, letting the last echoes of the immense energy wash over them, a silent acknowledgment of the profound connection they had briefly shared with the heart of the world. Shadows began to creep back into the furthest corners, soft and yielding, as the radiance softened, but the feeling of being touched by something vast and ancient remained, a quiet warmth nestled deep within.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe luminous afterglow continued its slow fade, the twilight hues deepening into shadow. The air, still carrying that faint, starlike scent, grew cool against their skin. A quiet sigh escaped a weary figure, a soft sound in the vast stillness. Eyes met across the space, sharing a silent acknowledgment of the profound experience. The ancient stone walls, now less brightly lit, seemed to hold the memory of the light within their very structure. The only sound was the distant, rhythmic drip of water, a steady pulse against the receding magic. They lingered, letting the quiet peace settle, knowing the path ahead waited, but unwilling to break the spell of the moment just yet.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe last vestiges of the strange light retreated entirely, leaving the chamber cloaked in the deep, natural gloom of the underground. The air grew sharper, carrying the chill of the ancient stone and the steady, patient rhythm of the dripping water. Shadows pooled in every corner, swallowing the details that the earlier glow had revealed. A quiet rustle of fabric broke the stillness as a figure shifted, a silent signal that the moment of contemplation was drawing to a close. A hand reached out, finding another in the near-darkness, a brief, comforting touch. The path lay ahead, unseen in the darkness, but its presence was felt, a silent call to press onward into the quiet depths.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe silence of the chamber pressed in, broken only by their careful footsteps and the soft drip of water somewhere in the stone. They moved with purpose, their hands sweeping over rough surfaces, searching the hidden corners and crevices the previous light had only hinted at. Patience was their guide in the deep gloom. Near a collapsed archway, they discovered a cache containing **twenty** Celestial Orbs, nestled together like luminous eggs in a forgotten nest. They gathered these carefully, adding them to the pouch. Further along, a cluster of **nineteen** Celestial Orbs lay nestled within a shallow depression in the floor, their faint glow barely visible until they were close. These, too, were collected. Finally, tucked away in a narrow fissure that seemed to weep moisture, a lone Celestial Orb pulsed faintly, a hidden treasure waiting to be found. This **one** Celestial Orb was retrieved and added to their growing collection. With the newly found orbs secured, they brought them together with the significant mass they already carried, the culmination of their previous efforts, known only as The Aetherial Prime. As the new orbs merged with the existing collection, a subtle shift occurred, a deepening of the light, a resonance that hummed through the stone itself. The combined mass settled in the pouch, its presence now substantial, its form coalescing into something new, something powerful. This unified, potent accumulation was no longer just a collection; it had become The Astral Core.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe weight of the coalesced light settled in their grasp, a comforting warmth against the chill of the deep stone. A faint hum resonated from the pouch, a silent promise echoing in the cavern's stillness. Dust motes danced in the lingering glow, caught in the currents of air disturbed by their movements. Shadows stretched and deepened around ancient pillars, reclaiming the spaces briefly illuminated. A sense of completion, quiet and profound, settled upon them as they exchanged knowing glances in the soft radiance. The air tasted of damp earth and forgotten ages, and the path ahead remained shrouded.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe soft hum of the pouch faded, leaving the cavern's ancient silence to press in once more. The air, thick with the scent of undisturbed stone and secrets long buried, seemed to hold its breath around them. Dust motes settled slowly, the brief dance of light concluded. A shared glance passed between them, a silent acknowledgment of the weight now carried and the journey yet to unfold. The path twisted ahead, a mere suggestion swallowed by the encroaching darkness, promising only deeper mystery and the echoing drip of unseen water. Resolve hardened within them, a quiet counterpoint to the vast, indifferent stone that surrounded their small pool of light. They turned towards the unknown, the whispers of the deep beckoning them onward.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey stepped into the deeper gloom, the faint light of their lamp struggling against the oppressive dark. The air grew colder, carrying the faint, metallic tang of deep earth. Each footfall seemed to echo endlessly, swallowed eventually by the vast, unseen chambers surrounding them. The path, uneven and slick with moisture, wound through formations that loomed like sleeping giants in the periphery of their vision. A constant, rhythmic *drip... drip... drip* sounded from somewhere ahead, a lonely heartbeat in the stone's immense silence. The weight of the ancient place pressed down, a palpable presence that tested their resolve with every shadow that seemed to shift just beyond the reach of their light. They moved as silent figures against the stone, their shared purpose a quiet beacon in the profound darkness.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe narrow passage eventually widened into a cavern of immense proportions. Their lamp, a solitary star in this subterranean sky, cast dancing shadows that played tricks on the eye, making stalactites seem like grasping claws and pillars like stooped figures. The air hung heavy, still and cold, carrying the scent of damp earth and something else, something older and harder to place. Each breath felt shallow, stolen from the stone's vast lungs. They walked close together, their boots scraping softly on the uneven floor, a small island of life in an ocean of rock and silence. The constant *drip... drip* from the passage behind them faded, replaced by a deeper, more resonant silence that seemed to absorb all sound. A shiver, not entirely from the cold, traced a path down a spine. The stone seemed to watch.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey stood for a moment, letting the sheer scale of the chamber wash over them. The lamp's meager glow struggled against the vastness, illuminating only a small circle around their feet and the lower reaches of the colossal pillars that held the roof aloft. Higher up, darkness reigned supreme, a tangible weight pressing down from the unseen ceiling. Dust motes danced in the light beam, tiny specks adrift in the ancient air. A quiet sigh escaped parched lips. Beside them, a hand rested lightly on a weapon hilt, a silent acknowledgment of the tension that hummed beneath the silence. The stone walls felt rough beneath tentative fingers, cold and indifferent to their presence. There was a feeling of immense time held within this place, of ages passing while the rock remained, unchanging, patient.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nHope, a fragile thing, began to stir as they moved deeper into the echoing space. The lamp beam finally caught on something – a faint luminescence emanating from a recess in the stone. Carefully, they approached. Nested within a crystalline growth were Celestial Orbs, their light soft and steady. They counted them, finding **eighteen** nestled there. A quiet murmur of success passed between them.\n\nFurther exploration revealed another pocket, tucked behind a fallen section of masonry. This cache held a smaller collection, only **eight** of the glowing spheres, but each pulsed with potent energy. They gathered these as well, adding them to the growing collection.\n\nThe path led onward, past more silent pillars, until they reached a shallow pool of still, dark water. Submerged just beneath the surface, visible through the clear liquid, lay another group. Patiently, they retrieved these, discovering there were **sixteen** orbs resting in the watery cradle.\n\nFinally, near the center of the vast chamber, they found a pedestal, seemingly empty at first glance. But a hidden mechanism, triggered by a pressure plate, caused a section of the floor to slide open, revealing a deep vault. Within, resting on a bed of fine, ancient sand, was the largest discovery yet: **thirty** Celestial Orbs, their combined radiance almost blinding in the darkness.\n\nWith these new acquisitions secured, they carefully brought forth the container holding The Astral Core, the result of their previous arduous journey. With reverence and care, all the gathered orbs – the newly found groups and the revered Astral Core itself – were combined into a magnificent accumulation on the central pedestal. As the last orb settled into place, the chamber filled with a profound, resonant light, a unified pulse of power that seemed to beat in time with their own hearts. This potent, unified collection, radiating with immense energy, was now known to them as The Celestial Heart.", "question": "---\n\n**Question:** The story describes a sequence of operations that modify a quantifiable measure related to 'Celestial Orbs'. Following this entire sequence, what is the final, precise numerical value of this measure at the conclusion of all activities? Provide only the single integer.", "full_text_for_eval": "The wind howled across the sky-bridge, a narrow spine of ancient stone arcing between colossal islands that drifted like silent ships in the bruised twilight. Far below, the world was a swirling abyss of mist and shadow.\n\nA small figure, cloaked and agile, moved with practiced silence along the bridge's crumbling edge. Lyra Swiftwing, her halfling form a part of the deepening gloom, paused near a weathered parapet. Her sharp eyes scanned the distant island, its peaks crowned with the skeletal remains of structures that predated memory. Something pulsed there, a faint, ethereal light visible only to those who knew where to look. A Celestial Orb.\n\nAnother shadow detached itself from the very air behind her. Taller, leaner, with a subtle, non-human grace. Anya Shadowwalker, the tiefling assassin, her gaze intense even in the low light.\n\n\"It's there,\" Lyra murmured, not turning.\n\n\"I know,\" Anya's voice was low, a rasp of dry leaves. \"Getting to it will be... challenging. The guardians are restless. And the darkness gathers.\"\n\nShe gestured towards the horizon, where an unnatural inkiness seemed to devour the stars before they could even fully emerge. This was the returning tide they feared. The Orbs were the only hope, the legends whispered, but finding them was a perilous quest. And this particular Orb... it held a power unlike the others. A power that could tip the balance.\n\nLyra tightened her grip on the small pack slung across her shoulder. \"Challenging is my favorite kind of job.\"\n\nAnya gave a faint, almost imperceptible nod. Their paths had converged for this purpose, drawn by the same desperate need, the same dangerous secret. The Orb awaited. And the night was vast.\n\n...And the night was vast.\nThey moved like wraiths through the skeletal remains of the sky-city, guided by instinct and faint, resonant hum. The air grew colder, charged with ancient power. Their quarry, the Orb, was close, but the path was littered with remnants of its kind. Lyra pointed towards a cracked pedestal half-buried in rubble. In it lay **eight** Celestial Orbs, their light muted but steady. Anya nodded, her eyes scanning the crumbling structure above. Embedded in the stone wall were **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, glowing faintly, clinging to the precipice.\nThey scaled the broken masonry, the wind whipping around them. Across a narrow, precarious bridge, a small niche offered refuge, and within it rested **sixteen** Celestial Orbs, radiating a soft warmth. Descending into a shadowed chamber, the floor was scattered with **fifteen** Celestial Orbs, like fallen stars. Anya found a hidden compartment behind a loose panel; it contained **twenty** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces surprisingly smooth.\nThey navigated winding tunnels beneath the city's foundation. Deep within, a damp recess revealed **nine** Celestial Orbs clustered together, their hum a low thrum against the stone. Emerging into a larger cavern, they saw, arranged in a complex, forgotten pattern in the center, **twenty-three** Celestial Orbs, pulsing in unison. Closer to their ultimate destination, nestled near the entrance to the inner sanctum, a final cluster of **eighteen** Celestial Orbs pulsed with an undeniable, unified light.\nAs they observed these varied collections, a realization dawned. It wasn't just the quantity of Orbs, but a shared quality, an underlying vibration, a core luminescence that seemed consistent regardless of the size of the cluster or its location. It was the heart of their power, the fundamental spark. This, Lyra thought, feeling the resonance in her bones, this must be it. The Celestial Essence.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe hum of the Orbs faded slightly, leaving a profound silence in the ancient stone chamber. Lyra felt the truth of their discovery settle deep within her, a resonance that echoed the faint pulse of the Essence. The air hung heavy with the weight of forgotten ages, the scent of damp earth and old magic clinging to the shadows. Anya stood beside her, her gaze fixed on the dark opening that promised the heart of the ruins. The path forward beckoned, fraught with the unknown, yet illuminated by the understanding they had just found.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe silence that followed the Orbs' song was profound, a heavy cloak draped over the stone. Dust motes danced in the faint light filtering from above, swirling around the ancient carvings that adorned the walls. Lyra pressed a hand to the cool stone, feeling the deep thrum of the earth beneath the ruin. Anya turned from the dark passage, her eyes reflecting the dim glow, a mixture of resolve and apprehension etched upon her face. The air grew colder as they contemplated the unknown depths ahead, the scent of damp stone and forgotten secrets beckoning them deeper into the heart of the mountain. A breath held, a threshold crossed, was all that lay between them and whatever awaited in the darkness.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nAnya took the step, her form swallowed by the encroaching gloom of the passage. Lyra followed, the faint light from the chamber behind them shrinking to nothing as they moved deeper. The air here was different, colder still, carrying a faint, unsettling hum that seemed to vibrate in their teeth. The walls pressed close, slick with dampness, the stone rough beneath their fingertips as they occasionally brushed against it for guidance. Silence reigned, a heavy blanket muffling even the sound of their own footsteps, amplifying the beat of their hearts in their ears. Ahead, the darkness was absolute, a tangible presence that promised both revelation and peril in equal measure. They walked into the mountain's embrace, leaving the echoes of the Orbs' song far behind.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey moved deeper into the mountain's throat, the passage walls slick and cold against their occasional touch. The air hung stagnant, carrying the faint, metallic tang of deep earth and something else, something ancient and undisturbed. The unsettling hum persisted, a low vibration that seemed to originate from the very stone around them, a silent song only their bones could hear. Lyra kept close behind Anya, the rustle of their cloaks the only sound besides their own careful breathing and the distant, rhythmic drip of water echoing from somewhere unseen ahead. The darkness was absolute, a heavy cloak that pressed in from all sides, demanding trust in touch and instinct alone. Each step was a venture into the unknown, leaving the world above and its familiar light further behind with every measured pace.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air grew heavier, thick with the scent of damp stone and forgotten time. Their hands brushed against the rough, unyielding rock face, cool and damp beneath their touch. Silence pressed in, broken only by their own measured breaths and the distant, persistent chime of water finding its way through the living rock. Each step felt deliberate, a commitment deeper into the mountain's heart, where the sun's light had never reached. The darkness was a palpable presence, a blindfold demanding faith in the feel of the ground and the sound of their companion's movement close behind. They moved as shadows within shadows, drawn onward by the faint, resonant hum that seemed to guide them deeper into the earth's silent, ancient core.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe air grew heavier, thick with the scent of damp stone and forgotten time.

They moved as shadows within shadows, drawn onward by the faint, resonant hum that seemed to guide them deeper into the earth's silent, ancient core.\n\nRounding a bend, they found a small fissure barely wide enough to peer into. Within, nestled on a ledge, were two Celestial Orbs, their light a faint pulse against the dark. Further down the passage, the air grew warmer, and they discovered a cluster of four Orbs embedded in the cavern wall, their glow steady and calm. The path opened into a vast, echoing chamber where a subterranean stream flowed. Submerged just beneath the surface, they saw seven Orbs, their radiance diffused by the water.\n\nContinuing their descent, they navigated treacherous ledges and narrow tunnels. In a hidden alcove, shielded by a curtain of rock, fifteen Orbs pulsed with a soft, rhythmic light, unlike the others. Deeper still, the hum intensified. They entered a wide grotto, and there, resting on a pedestal of natural stone, was a striking collection of twenty-five Orbs, their combined light casting dancing shadows across the rough-hewn walls.\n\nFinally, they reached the heart of the mountain, a vast, silent cathedral of stone. And there, filling a massive hollow, was the source of the hum, a breathtaking assembly of thirty Celestial Orbs, their light a powerful, almost overwhelming beacon. Comparing the energy emanating from this immense find to the faint echo of The Celestial Essence they carried, or the distinct pulses from the smaller caches, it was clear which held the greatest potential. This unparalleled concentration, radiating pure, untamed power, was recognized instantly as something new, something ultimate. They designated this profound discovery, this apex of power deep within the earth, as The Celestial Prime.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air in the vast chamber pulsed with a light that was more than mere illumination; it was a palpable presence, warm and vital, filling the immense space from floor to towering ceiling. Dust motes danced in the radiance, swirling like golden snow in the silent air. The stone walls, rough-hewn and ancient, seemed to absorb and reflect the energy, creating dancing shadows that shifted with the Orbs' steady thrum. A deep sense of awe settled over the companions, the journey's fatigue momentarily forgotten in the face of such raw, untamed power. The silence, broken only by the deep resonance, felt ancient and profound, holding the weight of ages within its stillness.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe pervasive light warmed their skin, a gentle pressure that seemed to resonate within their very core. It carried the weight of ages, a silent hum that spoke of power beyond mortal reckoning. Elara extended a hand slowly into the glowing air, her fingers trembling with the sheer intensity of the energy. Beside her, Kaelen watched the radiant source, his face a mask of silent reverence. Borin let out a low sound, a rumble of awe that acknowledged the raw force filling the space. They exchanged glances, a shared understanding passing between them without a word, a mutual recognition of the profound mystery that enveloped them. The golden dust continued its slow, mesmerizing swirl, caught forever in the heart of the timeless glow.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe pervasive light deepened, shifting from gold to a richer, warmer hue that pulsed gently, like a colossal heart beating in the stillness. It painted long, stretching shadows that danced and writhed along unseen surfaces, hinting at forms just beyond comprehension. Elara opened her eyes, the light no longer just external but seeming to fill her vision from within, illuminating thoughts she hadn't known she possessed. Kaelen reached out, not to touch the light directly, but to feel the warmth radiating from the air around it, a silent acknowledgment of its power. Borin let out a soft sigh, the sound lost almost instantly in the profound silence, a silence that wasn't empty but full of the ancient hum. They stood bathed in the glow, figures etched against eternity, bound together by the shared experience of the impossible.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe profound radiance began to recede, not abruptly, but like a slow, deep breath being exhaled by the world itself. The vibrant pulse softened, the light withdrawing its intense embrace, leaving behind an air that felt both cleansed and heavy with memory. The long shadows, which had danced with impossible life, settled back into their familiar, static forms, though they seemed deeper now, holding secrets whispered by the departed glow.\n\nA different silence descended, not the expectant hush that preceded the light, but a resonant quiet, filled with the echo of immense power. Borin let out a slow breath, the sound loud in the sudden stillness. Kaelen’s hand, which had reached towards the warmth, lowered slowly, his fingers flexing as if grasping something invisible. Elara blinked, the afterimage of the brilliant hue lingering behind her eyes, painting the dimming surroundings with ethereal strokes. They stood, figures etched against the returning gloom, bound by the unspoken understanding of having witnessed something truly beyond the veil. The stone beneath their feet felt solid once more, a grounding anchor after moments adrift in the infinite.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow. Borin shifted his weight, the leather of his armor creaking softly, his gaze sweeping the now-dim chamber as if searching for echoes of the departed radiance. Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep. They stood there for a time, letting the world settle, letting their own hearts find a steady rhythm again, the cool, real stone beneath their boots a welcome anchor.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nSlowly, they began to move, their boots crunching on fallen stone dust. The chamber was vast, its edges lost in shadow, but littered with the debris of ages. They split up, flash-lamps cutting swathes through the gloom, searching for anything missed in the initial chaos. Borin found a cluster first, nestled in a cracked pedestal – a small cache of Celestial Orbs, numbering just **four**. Further along, near a collapsed archway, Kaelen unearthed a sealed lead box containing a larger collection – **twenty-one** of the glowing spheres. Elara, exploring a niche behind a crumbling statue, discovered a tightly packed grouping – precisely **six** Celestial Orbs. Deep within a narrow fissure, Borin called out again, having found another, distinct pocket – another **six** of the shimmering orbs. Kaelen then located a scattered trail leading to a hidden cavity; within lay **seven** Celestial Orbs, pulsing faintly. Finally, Elara found a large, ornate chest, mostly buried, which held a significant hoard – **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, their light muted by the ancient wood.\n\nThey gathered the discovered orbs, placing them carefully on a flat stone surface, the different quantities laid out before them. The light they cast was varied, some bright, others dim. They looked at the disparate piles, considering their meaning. They also remembered the power of **The Celestial Prime**, the immense energy they had just witnessed, a force that felt like a cornerstone to all these smaller findings.\n\n\"So many,\" Borin murmured, gesturing at the collections.\n\nKaelen knelt, his fingers hovering over the different groups. \"We have these... and the echoes of **The Celestial Prime**.\" His gaze settled on that particular group. \"Look at these,\" he said softly. \"Compared to the others, this group seems... centered. Balanced. Not the fewest, not the most, not clustered with the others of similar count. They feel like the pivot point, the still eye in the storm of all this rediscovered power.\"\n\nElara nodded slowly, her eyes fixed on the group Kaelen indicated. \"Yes,\" she breathed. \"The axis around which the others might turn. The core frequency.\"\n\nKaelen carefully picked up a single orb from that specific group, its light steady and calm. \"This group,\" he declared, holding the orb aloft, \"this is the **Celestial Axis**.\"\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe cavern air settled around them, thick with the scent of ancient dust and the faint, metallic tang of power. The collected orbs lay upon the stone, their individual lights weaving a tapestry of soft, shifting hues across the rough walls. Elara felt the quiet hum emanating from the stones, a resonance that seemed to echo the vast, formless energy they had encountered before. Borin ran a hand over the cool, damp rock face nearby, his thoughts seemingly lost in the deep quiet of the earth. Kaelen still held the orb designated as the Axis, its steady glow a calm point amidst the others. A profound stillness descended, broken only by the subtle whisper of air currents deep within the subterranean passages. They remained there for a long moment, absorbing the significance of their find, the weight of potential hanging palpable in the air.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air in the cavern remained heavy, thick with the scent of the deep earth and the faint, almost sweet perfume of raw power. The collected lights from the orbs pulsed softly, painting the rough-hewn walls with shifting hues of gold, sapphire, and emerald. Elara closed her eyes for a breath, feeling the deep resonance within her bones, a silent echo of the vast energies they had touched. It was a connection both ancient and new, a thread woven between her spirit and the heart of the world. Borin finally lowered his hand from the damp stone, his gaze sweeping across the array of glowing spheres, a quiet contemplation etched upon his face. Kaelen shifted his weight slightly, the weight of the Axis orb in his hand a steady anchor in the profound stillness. Outside the immediate pool of light, shadows clung to the cavern's edges, vast and impenetrable, hinting at the paths yet untrodden and the secrets still held within the earth's embrace. A subtle chill seemed to creep into the air, a silent signal that the moment of quiet reflection must soon give way to the next step.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey turned their backs on the fading glow, the vibrant hues retreating as they moved towards the cavern's edge. A deeper darkness awaited, a silent, absolute void that seemed to press in from the surrounding gloom. The air grew noticeably cooler, carrying the sharp tang of mineral and the faint, earthy smell of undisturbed stone. Borin raised his lantern, its beam cutting a hesitant path into the gloom. Kaelen adjusted his grip on the weight he carried, his steps steady despite the uncertainty ahead. Elara felt the shift in the earth's energy, the powerful resonance of the chamber left behind replaced by a quiet, ancient stillness that settled deep within her bones. They stepped forward, leaving the pool of light, trusting the unseen path to guide them deeper into the mountain's heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe vibrant light of the chamber receded entirely, leaving them enveloped in a profound, echoing darkness. Borin’s lantern cast a small, trembling circle of illumination that seemed only to emphasize the vastness of the void beyond its reach. The air grew heavier, thick with the scent of damp earth and ancient stone, carrying a silence so complete it felt like a physical weight. Kaelen shifted the burden he carried, the faint scrape of material against his shoulder a jarring sound in the stillness. Elara closed her eyes for a moment, letting the mountain’s deep, resonant quiet flow through her, a stark contrast to the vibrant energy left behind. They moved forward deliberately, trusting their senses and the faint, unseen path beneath their feet, deeper into the mountain’s unyielding heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark. Each step echoed softly in the vast quiet, swallowed almost instantly by the stone. Borin kept the light low and steady, his gaze fixed on the ground just ahead. Kaelen shifted his burden, the familiar weight a small comfort in the overwhelming unknown. Elara trailed a hand along the damp, rough-hewn wall beside her, feeling the mountain's immense, silent presence. The air grew heavy with the scent of deep earth and something else, something ancient and undisturbed. A profound stillness settled around them, broken only by the faint, rhythmic sound of their own passage, drawing them further into the mountain's unyielding heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe air grew heavy with the scent of deep earth and something else, something ancient and undisturbed. A profound stillness settled around them, broken only by the faint, rhythmic sound of their own passage, drawing them further into the mountain's unyielding heart.\n\nThey followed a narrow, winding passage that opened into a vast cavern, its ceiling lost in shadow. Around the cavern's edge, in scattered depressions and on rocky shelves, lay the objects of their quest. Borin raised the lantern, its beam sweeping across the space.\n\n\"Look,\" Elara whispered, pointing. In a shallow depression near the entrance lay a small cluster of **two** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces gleaming faintly even in the low light. Further along, on a jagged ledge, was a slightly larger grouping of **four**. Kaelen moved carefully towards a wider alcove, finding a scattered collection of **eight** Celestial Orbs spread across the dusty floor.\n\nTheir search continued, revealing more. Within a crumbling section of the far wall, they uncovered a discovery of **seventeen** Celestial Orbs, nestled together as if hidden deliberately long ago. Deeper in the cavern, near a pool of still, dark water, they found a significant deposit of **twenty-eight** Celestial Orbs, their combined glow casting an ethereal light. Moving into a side chamber they hadn't noticed before, Borin's lantern illuminated a second, equally large hoard of **twenty-eight** Celestial Orbs, filling a natural basin in the rock. Elara's breath hitched as she spotted an impressive cache holding **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs tucked beneath a rocky overhang.\n\nThey surveyed the different findings. Compared to the lesser quantities, these larger concentrations pulsed with undeniable power, dwarfing even the memory of the **Celestial Axis**. The energy radiating from the most potent of these caches was overwhelming, a clear focal point among all they had uncovered. This preeminent quantity, this heart of power they had sought, was clearly paramount. They knew this was it. This was the source they would henceforth refer to as **The Star's Eye**.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nA profound silence settled upon the cavern, broken only by the faint, resonant hum emanating from the heart of their discovery. The air itself seemed to thicken, heavy with the weight of ancient power. Kaelen knelt near the radiant cache, his fingers tracing patterns on the cool stone floor, lost in contemplation. Borin held his lantern aloft, its mundane glow paling against the ethereal light of The Star's Eye, a look of weary wonder etched upon his face. Elara simply stood, her breath held captive, her gaze fixed upon the pulsing energy, a deep and abiding sense of awe washing over her. Around them, the shadows deepened, the cavern walls seeming to lean in, guardians of this potent secret.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe profound silence held them captive, punctuated only by the deep, resonant hum that seemed to vibrate in their very bones. The air grew heavier still, thick with the scent of damp earth and something else, something ancient and potent. Elara felt the cavern walls pressing in, not with malice, but with the quiet watchfulness of ages. The ethereal light of the artifact pulsed steadily, casting dancing shadows that seemed to whisper secrets only the stone remembered. Borin shifted slightly, his joints protesting the long journey, but his gaze remained fixed on the radiant energy, his weariness momentarily forgotten in the face of such impossible beauty. Kaelen remained lost in thought, his fingers still tracing invisible patterns on the cool floor, a silent figure against the backdrop of the otherworldly glow. Time seemed to stretch and warp in this hidden place, measured only by the steady thrum of the power they had unearthed.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe deep hum resonated not just in their bones, but in the very air surrounding them. Elara felt the cavern breathe, a slow, ancient inhalation and exhalation against her skin. The scent of damp earth mingled with the sharp, clean energy of the artifact, a strange perfume of deep time and potent magic. Borin shifted again, a low groan escaping him, yet his eyes remained fixed on the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent awe etched upon his face. Kaelen rose slowly, his movements deliberate, his gaze sweeping across the dancing shadows as if searching for answers hidden within the shifting light. The silence, profound and watchful, seemed to hold its breath alongside them.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air thrummed with a low, resonant energy that seemed to seep into their very bones. Shadows stretched and writhed across the uneven stone, cast by the artifact's persistent glow. A scent, earthy and sharp, filled the space, a perfume of deep time and potent power. Elara felt the cavern breathe around them, a slow, steady pulse against her skin. Borin shifted, a soft sound escaping him, his gaze still held by the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent wonder etched upon his face. Kaelen stood, his movements deliberate, his eyes sweeping the dancing darkness as if seeking secrets hidden within the shifting light. The silence that enveloped them was profound, watchful, holding its breath alongside their own.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe heavy air pressed in, thick with the scent of ancient stone and something else, something wild and untamed. Elara closed her eyes for a moment, letting the cavern's pulse resonate through her, a deep, slow beat that felt older than time itself. Borin sighed softly beside her, a sound lost almost instantly in the profound quiet, his gaze still fixed on the source of the light, a silent reverence in his posture. Kaelen remained a still, watchful presence, his attention sharp, scanning the edges of the chamber where the light failed and the true darkness began. Each breath they took felt deliberate, loud in the stillness, a fragile counterpoint to the immense, silent power that filled the space. The shadows danced, not randomly, but with a strange, almost purposeful grace, as if they were living things, observing them in turn. A chill, not of cold but of immense age, settled upon their skin. The silence deepened, becoming a tangible weight, pressing upon their thoughts, urging them to simply *be* in the presence of something vast and unknowable.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe silence deepened, becoming a tangible weight, pressing upon their thoughts, urging them to simply *be* in the presence of something vast and unknowable. Elara broke the spell, her voice a low murmur. \"We must gather them. All of them.\" She gestured towards the glowing core of the chamber, where the energy of 'The Star's Eye' pulsed. Carefully, reverently, they began the process. From a hidden niche in the rock face, Borin retrieved a cluster of **eight** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces cool despite the ambient warmth. Kaelen, examining a crystalline growth near the chamber's edge, discovered a vein containing **ten** more, embedded like luminous jewels. Elara herself located a small, intricately carved box holding **nine** orbs, their light muted but steady. Deeper within the chamber, almost hidden by shadow, lay a larger cache – a spill of **twenty-four** orbs, scattered across a natural pedestal. Finally, tucked into a high, narrow fissure, they found another group of **nine** orbs, nestled together.\n\nAs each quantity was added to the area around 'The Star's Eye', the chamber's resonance intensified. The individual lights merged, swirling into a single, blinding vortex of energy. It didn't simply grow brighter; it began to cycle, to pulse with an intricate, internal rhythm. Elara raised the focusing crystal, directing the chaotic energy onto a flat, ancient stone. The light settled, forming a dynamic pattern that shifted and reformed continuously. It was a complex, fluid dance, a visual representation of the energy's core nature. Kaelen leaned closer, his eyes sharp. \"Look,\" he said, pointing. \"The fundamental pattern, the repeating core essence... it reveals itself in the cycle.\" Borin nodded slowly, a look of profound understanding dawning on his face. This repeating sequence, this fundamental rhythm, this was the essence they sought. This was the heart of the chamber's power. This, they knew, was 'The Celestial Key'.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe vibrant energy subsided, leaving behind a profound stillness in the ancient chamber. The complex pattern pulsed softly on the stone, a quiet echo of the power that had flowed through the air moments ago. Kaelen ran a hand through his hair, his eyes still adjusting from the brilliance. Elara carefully placed the focusing crystal onto a nearby ledge, her fingers lingering on its smooth surface. Borin let out a slow breath, the tension easing from his shoulders, replaced by a deep, quiet understanding. The air felt different now, charged with the weight of their discovery and the silent promise of the path that lay ahead. They had found the key, its essence captured, but the lock it would open remained a mystery waiting in the shadows.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nA profound silence descended upon the ancient space, broken only by the soft echo of their own breathing. Dust motes danced in a shaft of light piercing the gloom from a high vent. Kaelen met Elara's gaze across the pulsing symbol, a silent acknowledgement passing between them – the weight of their accomplishment mingling with the daunting uncertainty of what lay beyond this threshold. Borin rested a hand on the cool, worn stone of the wall, feeling the deep history embedded there, a history that now intertwined with their own fate. The air, thick with residual power, seemed to hum with unspoken questions, hinting at trials yet to face, secrets yet to unravel, and a destiny that felt both near and impossibly distant. They lingered in the quiet, absorbing the moment before the world outside the chamber reclaimed them.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe profound silence held them, a heavy cloak woven from ancient stone and residual power. Dust motes continued their slow, silent ballet in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom. Kaelen finally turned from the fading luminescence of the symbol, his eyes scanning the shadowed passage that beckoned them onward. Elara moved to his side, her touch lingering on the cool air where the energy had thrummed moments before. Borin pushed away from the wall, a deep breath escaping him, the sound soft in the stillness. They left the heart of the chamber, stepping back into the less charged air of the corridor, the weight of their accomplishment and the daunting unknown ahead settling upon them like a physical mantle as they faced the path forward.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey moved deeper into the passage, leaving the charged air of the chamber behind. The corridor walls were rough-hewn stone, slick with ancient damp, and the air grew cooler, carrying the faint, earthy scent of deep places. Shadows stretched and danced ahead of them, swallowing the meager light cast by Kaelen's lamp. Elara kept close, her hand occasionally brushing against his arm, a silent anchor in the encroaching gloom. Borin's heavy steps echoed softly, a steady rhythm against the silence that pressed in from all sides. The path twisted and turned, each bend revealing only more stone, more shadow, a relentless descent into the earth's forgotten heart. Uncertainty settled upon them, a quiet weight accompanying their weary steps.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe passage continued its relentless descent, the rough-hewn walls slick with perpetual dampness. The air grew colder still, thick with the earthy smell of deep stone and unseen water. Kaelen's lamp cast a meager pool of light that struggled against the encroaching shadow, illuminating only a few paces ahead before the darkness swallowed everything. Elara stayed close, her hand occasionally finding his arm, a silent reassurance in the oppressive quiet. Borin's heavy tread echoed steadily behind them, a constant presence against the silence that pressed in from all sides. Each turn revealed only more of the same – the endless stone, the creeping gloom, the slow, wearying journey into the earth's embrace. A profound sense of isolation settled upon them, a quiet understanding that they were far removed from the world above, lost in the labyrinthine depths.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air grew heavy and still, carrying the chill of ages past. Kaelen's lamp cast only a small, flickering circle of defiance against the absolute blackness that pressed in from all sides, revealing nothing but the same slick, unyielding stone. The silence here was not an absence of sound, but a tangible presence, broken only by the soft scrape of their boots and the steady rhythm of their breathing. Elara's hand remained a quiet comfort on his arm, a warm point in the pervasive cold. Behind them, Borin's solid form was a bulwark against the encroaching dark, his presence a quiet strength. They moved as a single entity through the deep, the world above feeling impossibly distant, utterly forgotten in the profound, ancient quiet of the earth's heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n...The air grew heavy and still, carrying the chill of ages past.

They moved as a single entity through the deep, the world above feeling impossibly distant, utterly forgotten in the profound, ancient quiet of the earth's heart.\n\nSuddenly, the oppressive darkness seemed to thin, replaced by a faint, internal luminescence. Ahead, the passage widened into a series of small alcoves carved into the living rock. Within the first, nestled on a shelf of crystal, pulsed the soft light of **five** Celestial Orbs. They moved to the next, where a different arrangement of **eight** Celestial Orbs rested in a shallow basin of water that mirrored their glow. Further in, a deeper recess held a cluster of **nineteen** Celestial Orbs, their combined light creating a gentle warmth in the cool air. Across the way, suspended in a web of fine, metallic threads, hung **twenty-two** Celestial Orbs, shimmering like captured stars. Finally, the largest alcove opened into a small grotto, and there, filling the space with an intense, vibrant radiance, lay **twenty-eight** Celestial Orbs, their energy palpable even from a distance.\n\nThey stood before the collection of discoveries, their eyes drawn inevitably to the grotto. The power emanating from that final, largest group was undeniable, dwarfing the energies of the others. Kaelen stepped forward, his lamp now unnecessary in the face of the Orbs' brilliance. \"Look,\" he breathed, his voice echoing slightly in the space. \"Compared to this, even The Celestial Key feels like a whisper against a storm.\" Elara nodded, her gaze fixed on the radiant cluster. \"This concentration... this is the heartwood we sought.\" Borin placed a hand on Kaelen's shoulder, his voice low and resonant. \"This is the culmination. This supreme quantity... we shall name it The Aetherial Prime.\"\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air in the grotto thrummed with the concentrated energy of the orbs. Their combined radiance painted the rock walls in shifting hues of gold and sapphire, chasing away the last vestiges of shadow. A profound sense of awe settled upon the companions, a quiet reverence for the sheer power gathered in this hidden place. Kaelen reached out a hand, not touching, but feeling the warmth that emanated from the glowing cluster, a warmth that seemed to resonate deep within his bones. Elara closed her eyes for a moment, breathing in the charged air, a faint smile touching her lips as she felt the truth of their quest settle upon her like a mantle. Borin stood silent, his gaze steady, a flicker of ancient understanding in his eyes as he witnessed the heartwood of this place unveiled. The weight of their journey, the trials faced, the paths taken – all seemed to converge here, in the luminous presence of the Aetherial Prime.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe luminous presence of the Aetherial Prime bathed the grotto in an ethereal glow. The light, a blend of molten gold and deep ocean sapphire, danced across the uneven rock faces, revealing hidden facets and veins of glittering stone. The air itself felt alive, thick with a resonant energy that hummed against the skin like a gentle vibration. A profound stillness settled upon the companions, a quiet reverence that transcended spoken words. They simply stood, breathing in the charged atmosphere, letting the ancient power seep into their weary bones. The warmth emanating from the glowing cluster was not merely heat, but a deep, pervasive feeling of connection, a sense of being anchored to the very heart of the world. Shadows clung only to the deepest recesses, pushed back by the overwhelming radiance that filled the cavern, leaving no corner untouched by its transformative light.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe vibrant pulse of the Aetherial Prime gradually subsided, leaving behind a profound stillness that felt heavier than silence. The light, though diminished from its peak intensity, still painted the cavern walls with hues of twilight and dawn, its gentle glow revealing the intricate patterns etched into the ancient stone. The air, no longer vibrating with raw power, held a crisp, clean quality, carrying the faint scent of damp earth and something else, something akin to pure starlight. A deep, pervasive sense of peace settled over the weary travelers, a quiet contentment that seeped into their bones and eased the tension from their shoulders. They lingered in the luminous afterglow, letting the last echoes of the immense energy wash over them, a silent acknowledgment of the profound connection they had briefly shared with the heart of the world. Shadows began to creep back into the furthest corners, soft and yielding, as the radiance softened, but the feeling of being touched by something vast and ancient remained, a quiet warmth nestled deep within.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe luminous afterglow continued its slow fade, the twilight hues deepening into shadow. The air, still carrying that faint, starlike scent, grew cool against their skin. A quiet sigh escaped a weary figure, a soft sound in the vast stillness. Eyes met across the space, sharing a silent acknowledgment of the profound experience. The ancient stone walls, now less brightly lit, seemed to hold the memory of the light within their very structure. The only sound was the distant, rhythmic drip of water, a steady pulse against the receding magic. They lingered, letting the quiet peace settle, knowing the path ahead waited, but unwilling to break the spell of the moment just yet.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe last vestiges of the strange light retreated entirely, leaving the chamber cloaked in the deep, natural gloom of the underground. The air grew sharper, carrying the chill of the ancient stone and the steady, patient rhythm of the dripping water. Shadows pooled in every corner, swallowing the details that the earlier glow had revealed. A quiet rustle of fabric broke the stillness as a figure shifted, a silent signal that the moment of contemplation was drawing to a close. A hand reached out, finding another in the near-darkness, a brief, comforting touch. The path lay ahead, unseen in the darkness, but its presence was felt, a silent call to press onward into the quiet depths.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe silence of the chamber pressed in, broken only by their careful footsteps and the soft drip of water somewhere in the stone. They moved with purpose, their hands sweeping over rough surfaces, searching the hidden corners and crevices the previous light had only hinted at. Patience was their guide in the deep gloom. Near a collapsed archway, they discovered a cache containing **twenty** Celestial Orbs, nestled together like luminous eggs in a forgotten nest. They gathered these carefully, adding them to the pouch. Further along, a cluster of **nineteen** Celestial Orbs lay nestled within a shallow depression in the floor, their faint glow barely visible until they were close. These, too, were collected. Finally, tucked away in a narrow fissure that seemed to weep moisture, a lone Celestial Orb pulsed faintly, a hidden treasure waiting to be found. This **one** Celestial Orb was retrieved and added to their growing collection. With the newly found orbs secured, they brought them together with the significant mass they already carried, the culmination of their previous efforts, known only as The Aetherial Prime. As the new orbs merged with the existing collection, a subtle shift occurred, a deepening of the light, a resonance that hummed through the stone itself. The combined mass settled in the pouch, its presence now substantial, its form coalescing into something new, something powerful. This unified, potent accumulation was no longer just a collection; it had become The Astral Core.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe weight of the coalesced light settled in their grasp, a comforting warmth against the chill of the deep stone. A faint hum resonated from the pouch, a silent promise echoing in the cavern's stillness. Dust motes danced in the lingering glow, caught in the currents of air disturbed by their movements. Shadows stretched and deepened around ancient pillars, reclaiming the spaces briefly illuminated. A sense of completion, quiet and profound, settled upon them as they exchanged knowing glances in the soft radiance. The air tasted of damp earth and forgotten ages, and the path ahead remained shrouded.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe soft hum of the pouch faded, leaving the cavern's ancient silence to press in once more. The air, thick with the scent of undisturbed stone and secrets long buried, seemed to hold its breath around them. Dust motes settled slowly, the brief dance of light concluded. A shared glance passed between them, a silent acknowledgment of the weight now carried and the journey yet to unfold. The path twisted ahead, a mere suggestion swallowed by the encroaching darkness, promising only deeper mystery and the echoing drip of unseen water. Resolve hardened within them, a quiet counterpoint to the vast, indifferent stone that surrounded their small pool of light. They turned towards the unknown, the whispers of the deep beckoning them onward.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey stepped into the deeper gloom, the faint light of their lamp struggling against the oppressive dark. The air grew colder, carrying the faint, metallic tang of deep earth. Each footfall seemed to echo endlessly, swallowed eventually by the vast, unseen chambers surrounding them. The path, uneven and slick with moisture, wound through formations that loomed like sleeping giants in the periphery of their vision. A constant, rhythmic *drip... drip... drip* sounded from somewhere ahead, a lonely heartbeat in the stone's immense silence. The weight of the ancient place pressed down, a palpable presence that tested their resolve with every shadow that seemed to shift just beyond the reach of their light. They moved as silent figures against the stone, their shared purpose a quiet beacon in the profound darkness.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe narrow passage eventually widened into a cavern of immense proportions. Their lamp, a solitary star in this subterranean sky, cast dancing shadows that played tricks on the eye, making stalactites seem like grasping claws and pillars like stooped figures. The air hung heavy, still and cold, carrying the scent of damp earth and something else, something older and harder to place. Each breath felt shallow, stolen from the stone's vast lungs. They walked close together, their boots scraping softly on the uneven floor, a small island of life in an ocean of rock and silence. The constant *drip... drip* from the passage behind them faded, replaced by a deeper, more resonant silence that seemed to absorb all sound. A shiver, not entirely from the cold, traced a path down a spine. The stone seemed to watch.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey stood for a moment, letting the sheer scale of the chamber wash over them. The lamp's meager glow struggled against the vastness, illuminating only a small circle around their feet and the lower reaches of the colossal pillars that held the roof aloft. Higher up, darkness reigned supreme, a tangible weight pressing down from the unseen ceiling. Dust motes danced in the light beam, tiny specks adrift in the ancient air. A quiet sigh escaped parched lips. Beside them, a hand rested lightly on a weapon hilt, a silent acknowledgment of the tension that hummed beneath the silence. The stone walls felt rough beneath tentative fingers, cold and indifferent to their presence. There was a feeling of immense time held within this place, of ages passing while the rock remained, unchanging, patient.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nHope, a fragile thing, began to stir as they moved deeper into the echoing space. The lamp beam finally caught on something – a faint luminescence emanating from a recess in the stone. Carefully, they approached. Nested within a crystalline growth were Celestial Orbs, their light soft and steady. They counted them, finding **eighteen** nestled there. A quiet murmur of success passed between them.\n\nFurther exploration revealed another pocket, tucked behind a fallen section of masonry. This cache held a smaller collection, only **eight** of the glowing spheres, but each pulsed with potent energy. They gathered these as well, adding them to the growing collection.\n\nThe path led onward, past more silent pillars, until they reached a shallow pool of still, dark water. Submerged just beneath the surface, visible through the clear liquid, lay another group. Patiently, they retrieved these, discovering there were **sixteen** orbs resting in the watery cradle.\n\nFinally, near the center of the vast chamber, they found a pedestal, seemingly empty at first glance. But a hidden mechanism, triggered by a pressure plate, caused a section of the floor to slide open, revealing a deep vault. Within, resting on a bed of fine, ancient sand, was the largest discovery yet: **thirty** Celestial Orbs, their combined radiance almost blinding in the darkness.\n\nWith these new acquisitions secured, they carefully brought forth the container holding The Astral Core, the result of their previous arduous journey. With reverence and care, all the gathered orbs – the newly found groups and the revered Astral Core itself – were combined into a magnificent accumulation on the central pedestal. As the last orb settled into place, the chamber filled with a profound, resonant light, a unified pulse of power that seemed to beat in time with their own hearts. This potent, unified collection, radiating with immense energy, was now known to them as The Celestial Heart.\n\n---\n\n**Question:** The story describes a sequence of operations that modify a quantifiable measure related to 'Celestial Orbs'.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nThe scene should depict characters considering a set of 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL numbers with their frequencies: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'fifteen' (15), 'twenty' (20), 'nine' (9), 'twenty-three' (23), 'eighteen' (18), others being prior conceptual results like no prior calculated quantities). Their actions or observations should lead them to understand a 'typical', 'representative', or 'average' characteristic or measure across these items, without performing explicit mathematical division in the narrative.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'fifteen' (15), 'twenty' (20), 'nine' (9), 'twenty-three' (23), 'eighteen' (18) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis representative 'average' value (which is 'seventeen') will be conceptually known as 'The Celestial Essence' and must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seventeen' (17) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Celestial Essence' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene.

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'twenty' (20) and 'twenty-three' (23) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (integer-average (floored)) -- which is 'seventeen' (17) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Essence' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'seven' (7), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative.

This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...e very air behind her.

Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty' (20): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'twenty' (20) and 'twenty-three' (23) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (integer-average (floored)) -- which is 'seventeen' (17) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Essence' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'seven' (7), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seventeen' (17)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Essence'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., None) and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Celestial Orbs'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'thirty' (30), 'four' (4), 'fifteen' (15), 'twenty-five' (25), 'two' (2), 'seven' (7)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'The Celestial Essence').

Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Celestial Prime' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('thirty') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'thirty' (30) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency).

EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-five' (25): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'seven' (7) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'twenty-five' (25) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'thirty' (30) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Prime' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('thirty') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'thirty' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'thirty Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'thirty' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Celestial Prime', you MUST NOT use the word 'thirty' or the digit '30' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'thirty Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Celestial Prime') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'thirty', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Celestial Prime.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Celestial Prime represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'thirty' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Celestial Prime'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Essence'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air grew heavier, thick with the scent of damp stone and forgotten time.

The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Essence') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'thirty' (30), 'four' (4), 'fifteen' (15), 'twenty-five' (25), 'two' (2), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Celestial Prime'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('thirty').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'thirty' (30) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Celestial Prime' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('thirty') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'thirty' (30) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Celestial Prime' and NOT restate 'thirty' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.'

If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-five' (25): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'seven' (7) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'twenty-five' (25) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'thirty' (30) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Prime' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('thirty') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'thirty' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'thirty Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'thirty' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Celestial Prime', you MUST NOT use the word 'thirty' or the digit '30' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'thirty Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Celestial Prime') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'thirty', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Celestial Prime.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Celestial Prime represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'thirty' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Celestial Prime'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Essence'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'thirty' (30)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Prime'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Essence') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow.

Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow. Borin shifted his weight, the leather of his armor creaking softly, his gaze sweeping the now-dim chamber as if searching for echoes of the departed radiance. Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep. They stood there for a time, letting the world settle, letting their own hearts find a steady rhythm again, the cool, real stone beneath their boots a welcome anchor....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly.

Borin, his eyes sharp despite the dim light, spotted a small cache tucked into a crevice; it held twenty-seven Celestial Orbs. Further along, Kaelen found a small cluster of four orbs nestled in a hollow. Elara, running her hand along a smooth section of wall, discovered a hidden compartment containing twenty-one orbs. As they delved deeper, Borin located a worn leather pouch containing six orbs. Moments later, near a collapsed section of ceiling, Kaelen unearthed another, separate pouch containing six orbs, identical to the first. Finally, centered on a low, carved pedestal, they found a single arrangement of seven orbs, glowing faintly.\n\nThey gathered the orbs, laying them out before them. The disparate quantities pulsed with different intensities. Elara knelt, her fingers hovering over the various groups. There were many, few, and others in between. She looked from the largest collections to the smallest. Her gaze settled on the group resting on the pedestal, the one with the distinct, steady glow. \"This one,\" she murmured, touching the edge of the pedestal. \"This feels like the heart of it all. The point of balance.\" Kaelen and Borin followed her gaze, seeing the quiet power in that particular cluster. It was neither the greatest nor the least, but occupied a pivotal position amongst the others. \"The Celestial Axis,\" Borin breathed, giving it a name.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules.

Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A.

Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

Borin, his eyes sharp despite the dim light, spotted a small cache tucked into a crevice; it held twenty-seven Celestial Orbs. Further along, Kaelen found a small cluster of four orbs nestled in a hollow. Elara, running her hand along a smooth section of wall, discovered a hidden compartment containing twenty-one orbs. As they delved deeper, Borin located a worn leather pouch containing six orbs. Moments later, near a collapsed section of ceiling, Kaelen unearthed another, separate pouch containing six orbs, identical to the first. Finally, centered on a low, carved pedestal, they found a single arrangement of seven orbs, glowing faintly.\n\nThey gathered the orbs, laying them out before them. The disparate quantities pulsed with different intensities. Elara knelt, her fingers hovering over the various groups. There were many, few, and others in between. She looked from the largest collections to the smallest. Her gaze settled on the group resting on the pedestal, the one with the distinct, steady glow. \"This one,\" she murmured, touching the edge of the pedestal. \"This feels like the heart of it all. The point of balance.\" Kaelen and Borin followed her gaze, seeing the quiet power in that particular cluster. It was neither the greatest nor the least, but occupied a pivotal position amongst the others. \"The Celestial Axis,\" Borin breathed, giving it a name. It was the key to understanding how the energies here aligned, a central element around which all else seemed to pivot.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow. Borin shifted his weight, the leather of his armor creaking softly, his gaze sweeping the now-dim chamber as if searching for echoes of the departed radiance. Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep.

Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Prime') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Borin's keen eyes spotted a small cluster of Celestial Orbs tucked into a crevice near the floor. He counted them carefully: a distinct group of **four**. Deeper within the chamber, Kaelen found a collection in a shallow niche along the wall, revealing **six** Celestial Orbs nestled together. Moving further around the perimeter, Elara located another group, also of **six** Celestial Orbs, resting on a narrow ledge just out of reach.\n\nAs they ventured towards the center of the space, a solitary arrangement of **seven** Celestial Orbs pulsed with a faint, steady light unlike the others. It felt significant, positioned with deliberate care. Beyond it, a scattered pattern of **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs lay strewn across the floor, as if dropped in haste. Finally, near the far wall, Borin uncovered a large cache containing **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, a veritable hoard compared to the others.\n\nThey gathered near the central arrangement, the different quantities of Orbs they had found spread out or marked in their minds' eye. Borin gestured to the various discoveries. \"So many different counts... a chaotic distribution.\"\n\nKaelen knelt by the solitary arrangement they had found earlier. \"But this one,\" he said, his voice hushed, \"it feels different. Not the most, not the least, but perfectly balanced among them.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow. Borin shifted his weight, the leather of his armor creaking softly, his gaze sweeping the now-dim chamber as if searching for echoes of the departed radiance. Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep.

This revision MUST meticulously address all issues identified by the validator below, while also re-adhering to ALL original rules for this scene. Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**\n```text\nElara broke the silence first, her voice soft in the echoing chamber. \"The Orbs... they must be here.\"\n\nThey began to search, their footsteps muffled by the dust. Borin's keen eyes spotted a small cluster of Celestial Orbs tucked into a crevice near the floor. He counted them carefully: a distinct group of **four**. Deeper within the chamber, Kaelen found a collection in a shallow niche along the wall, revealing **six** Celestial Orbs nestled together. Moving further around the perimeter, Elara located another group, also of **six** Celestial Orbs, resting on a narrow ledge just out of reach.\n\nAs they ventured towards the center of the space, a solitary arrangement of **seven** Celestial Orbs pulsed with a faint, steady light unlike the others. It felt significant, positioned with deliberate care. Beyond it, a scattered pattern of **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs lay strewn across the floor, as if dropped in haste. Finally, near the far wall, Borin uncovered a large cache containing **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, a veritable hoard compared to the others.\n\nThey gathered near the central arrangement, the different quantities of Orbs they had found spread out or marked in their minds' eye. Borin gestured to the various discoveries. \"So many different counts... a chaotic distribution.\"\n\nKaelen knelt by the solitary arrangement they had found earlier. \"But this one,\" he said, his voice hushed, \"it feels different. Not the most, not the least, but perfectly balanced among them. Its position... its energy signature... it feels like the pivot point.\"\n\nElara nodded slowly, her gaze fixed on the **seven** orbs before them. \"The point of equilibrium,\" she murmured, understanding dawning in her eyes. \"The heart around which the others align. This,\" she declared, naming the conceptual discovery, \"is the **Celestial Axis**.\"\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2 (Explicit Result). Focus on: ensuring the number 'seven' appears exactly 1 time as an input, and ensuring the numerical result 'seven' is not stated when referring to the outcome group ('Celestial Axis').\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'seven' (value: 7) was explicitly stated again ('fixed on the seven orbs') when referring to the group identified as the outcome ('Celestial Axis'). For a MEDIAN operation, the numerical result must be implied via the conceptual name ('Celestial Axis') and not stated numerically in that context. The first mention of 'seven' as an input is correct, but the second mention referring to the outcome group is forbidden.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the frequency for 'seven' and the Rule 2 violation, remove the second mention of 'seven'. The sentence 'Elara nodded slowly, her gaze fixed on the seven orbs before them.' could be rephrased to refer to the group conceptually or by its position, without using the number 'seven' again, e.g., 'Elara nodded slowly, her gaze fixed on the solitary arrangement before them.'\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The beat text contains violations of the numerical and storytelling rules.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**.

Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules.

Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Prime') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Borin's keen eyes spotted a small cluster of Celestial Orbs tucked into a crevice near the floor. He counted them carefully: a distinct group of **four**. Deeper within the chamber, Kaelen found a collection in a shallow niche along the wall, revealing **six** Celestial Orbs nestled together. Moving further around the perimeter, Elara located another group, also of **six** Celestial Orbs, resting on a narrow ledge just out of reach.\n\nAs they ventured towards the center of the space, a solitary arrangement of **seven** Celestial Orbs pulsed with a faint, steady light unlike the others. It felt significant, positioned with deliberate care. Beyond it, a scattered pattern of **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs lay strewn across the floor, as if dropped in haste. Finally, near the far wall, Borin uncovered a large cache containing **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, a veritable hoard compared to the others.\n\nThey gathered near the central arrangement, the different quantities of Orbs they had found spread out or marked in their minds' eye. Borin gestured to the various discoveries. \"So many different counts... a chaotic distribution.\"\n\nKaelen knelt by the solitary arrangement they had found earlier. \"But this one,\" he said, his voice hushed, \"it feels different. Not the most, not the least, but perfectly balanced among them. Its position... its energy signature... it feels like the pivot point.\"\n\nElara nodded slowly, her gaze fixed on the solitary arrangement before them. \"The point of equilibrium,\" she murmured, understanding dawning in her eyes. \"The heart around which the others align.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative.

Borin knelt, running a gloved hand over the flagstones near the chamber's edge. \"There,\" he murmured, his voice low. His keen eyes spotted a small cluster nestled in a crevice – a group of **four** Celestial Orbs. Kaelen, examining a collapsed section further in, found a larger cache containing **six** of the luminous spheres. Deeper in the chamber, near a strange glyph, Elara discovered another distinct collection, also numbering **six** Celestial Orbs.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Prime') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Borin knelt, running a gloved hand over the flagstones near the chamber's edge. \"There,\" he murmured, his voice low. His keen eyes spotted a small cluster nestled in a crevice – a group of **four** Celestial Orbs. Kaelen, examining a collapsed section further in, found a larger cache containing **six** of the luminous spheres. Deeper in the chamber, near a strange glyph, Elara discovered another distinct collection, also numbering **six** Celestial Orbs. Further searching yielded a significant find – a cache holding **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs. Tucked away in a high alcove, almost hidden from view, was a smaller group of **seven** Celestial Orbs. And finally, near the chamber's entrance, they located the largest deposit yet – a staggering **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs.\n\nThey brought the disparate collections together, arranging them on a flat stone.

If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**.

Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow. Borin shifted his weight, the leather of his armor creaking softly, his gaze sweeping the now-dim chamber as if searching for echoes of the departed radiance. Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep.

This revision MUST meticulously address all issues identified by the validator below, while also re-adhering to ALL original rules for this scene. Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**\n```text\nThe cool, real stone beneath their boots was a welcome anchor, but the silence felt heavy, expectant. Borin knelt, running a gloved hand over the flagstones near the chamber's edge. \"There,\" he murmured, his voice low. His keen eyes spotted a small cluster nestled in a crevice – a group of **four** Celestial Orbs. Kaelen, examining a collapsed section further in, found a larger cache containing **six** of the luminous spheres. Deeper in the chamber, near a strange glyph, Elara discovered another distinct collection, also numbering **six** Celestial Orbs. Further searching yielded a significant find – a cache holding **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs. Tucked away in a high alcove, almost hidden from view, was a smaller group of **seven** Celestial Orbs. And finally, near the chamber's entrance, they located the largest deposit yet – a staggering **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs.\n\nThey brought the disparate collections together, arranging them on a flat stone. The smallest cluster sat to one side. Caches of similar size were placed next to it. Then came the slightly larger group, followed by the significantly bigger cache, and finally, the truly massive deposit. As they studied the arrangement, Elara pointed to the collection of seven orbs. \"Look,\" she murmured. \"Among all these, this particular group... it feels like the center. Not just in position, but in resonance. It's the balancing point between the smaller and larger quantities.\" Borin nodded slowly, his gaze fixed on the luminous spheres. \"The others orbit its significance,\" he rumbled. \"This must be it. The **Celestial Axis**.\"\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2 (Explicit Result). Focus on: ensuring the required input 'seven' appears exactly once, and ensuring the operation's result 'seven' is implied via 'Celestial Axis' without using the number word 'seven' again.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) as a distinct input but was found 2 time(s). This is an over-count. The first mention (a smaller group of seven Celestial Orbs) correctly fulfills the input requirement. The second mention (collection of seven orbs) is extraneous for Rule 1.A input counting.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'seven' (value: 7) was explicitly stated (collection of seven orbs) when identifying the median group ('Celestial Axis'). For a MEDIAN operation, the numerical result must NEVER be explicitly stated; it must only be implied via the conceptual name 'Celestial Axis'. The second mention of 'seven' violates this rule.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the frequency of 'seven' and ensure the result is implicit, remove the explicit mention of 'seven' when identifying the 'Celestial Axis' group. Instead of 'Elara pointed to the collection of seven orbs.', consider phrasing like 'Elara pointed to this particular group...' or 'Elara pointed to the group they had found in the high alcove...'. This refers to the group conceptually without restating the number 'seven'.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The beat violates multiple rules regarding numerical frequency and the handling of the operation's result.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) as a distinct input but was found 2 time(s).

The second mention (\"collection of seven orbs\") is extraneous for Rule 1.A input counting.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'seven' (value: 7) was explicitly stated (\"collection of seven orbs\") when identifying the median group ('Celestial Axis').

Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A.

Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Prime') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Borin knelt, running a gloved hand over the flagstones near the chamber's edge. \"There,\" he murmured, his voice low. His keen eyes spotted a small cluster nestled in a crevice – a group of **four** Celestial Orbs. Kaelen, examining a collapsed section further in, found a larger cache containing **six** of the luminous spheres. Deeper in the chamber, near a strange glyph, Elara discovered another distinct collection, also numbering **six** Celestial Orbs. Further searching yielded a significant find – a cache holding **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs. Tucked away in a high alcove, almost hidden from view, was a smaller group of **seven** Celestial Orbs. And finally, near the chamber's entrance, they located the largest deposit yet – a staggering **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs.\n\nThey brought the disparate collections together, arranging them on a flat stone. The smallest cluster sat to one side. Caches of similar size were placed next to it. Then came the slightly larger group, followed by the significantly bigger cache, and finally, the truly massive deposit. As they studied the arrangement, Elara pointed to this particular group. \"Look,\" she murmured. \"Among all these, this collection... it feels like the center. Not just in position, but in resonance. It's the balancing point between the smaller and larger quantities.\" Borin nodded slowly, his gaze fixed on the luminous spheres. \"The others orbit its significance,\" he rumbled. \"This must be it.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency).

The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names.

This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints.

Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow. Borin shifted his weight, the leather of his armor creaking softly, his gaze sweeping the now-dim chamber as if searching for echoes of the departed radiance. Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep. They stood there for a time, letting the world settle, letting their own hearts find a steady rhythm again, the cool, real stone beneath their boots a welcome anchor....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly. Do not add titles, notes, or anything outside the story itself.", "generator_output": "Slowly, they began to move, their boots crunching on fallen stone dust. The chamber was vast, its edges lost in shadow, but littered with the debris of ages. They split up, flash-lamps cutting swathes through the gloom, searching for anything missed in the initial chaos. Borin found a cluster first, nestled in a cracked pedestal – a small cache of Celestial Orbs, numbering just **four**. Further along, near a collapsed archway, Kaelen unearthed a sealed lead box containing a larger collection – **twenty-one** of the glowing spheres. Elara, exploring a niche behind a crumbling statue, discovered a tightly packed grouping – precisely **six** Celestial Orbs. Deep within a narrow fissure, Borin called out again, having found another, distinct pocket – another **six** of the shimmering orbs. Kaelen then located a scattered trail leading to a hidden cavity; within lay **seven** Celestial Orbs, pulsing faintly. Finally, Elara found a large, ornate chest, mostly buried, which held a significant hoard – **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, their light muted by the ancient wood.\n\nThey gathered the discovered orbs, placing them carefully on a flat stone surface, the different quantities laid out before them. The light they cast was varied, some bright, others dim. They looked at the disparate piles, considering their meaning. They also remembered the power of **The Celestial Prime**, the immense energy they had just witnessed, a force that felt like a cornerstone to all these smaller findings.\n\n\"So many,\" Borin murmured, gesturing at the collections.\n\nKaelen knelt, his fingers hovering over the different groups. \"We have these... and the echoes of **The Celestial Prime**.\" His gaze settled on the group numbering **seven**. \"Look at these,\" he said softly. \"Compared to the others, these seem... centered. Balanced. Not the fewest, not the most, not clustered with the others of similar count.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Prime') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Failure to adhere to these MEDIAN rules will result in rejection of your scene.", "generator_user_prompt": "Story Scene Task: Create the narrative for the step resulting in 'Celestial Axis' (Scene 3/8)\n\n**Background for Your Scene (Context for you, the writer - follow strict rules below for what appears in the story):**\n- Genre: High Fantasy / Adventure\n- Setting: A realm of floating islands connected by sky-bridges and airships, facing a returning ancient darkness.\n- Central Items in the Story: Celestial Orbs\n- Quantities from Previous Events (Conceptual Names & their values for your understanding - DO NOT use these values in the story): the concept known as 'The Celestial Prime' (which represents the numerical value 30)\n- New Numbers Introduced in this Scene (Values & their required frequencies for your understanding - Use word form in story, ALL must be mentioned with exact frequencies): 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27)\n\n**Your Scene's Core Action & Narrative Goal (Follow this closely):**\nThis scene needs to narrate an event or discovery that mirrors the mathematical operation: **median value**. The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow. Borin shifted his weight, the leather of his armor creaking softly, his gaze sweeping the now-dim chamber as if searching for echoes of the departed radiance. Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep.

This revision MUST meticulously address all issues identified by the validator below, while also re-adhering to ALL original rules for this scene. Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**\n```text\nSlowly, they began to move, their boots crunching on fallen stone dust. The chamber was vast, its edges lost in shadow, but littered with the debris of ages. They split up, flash-lamps cutting swathes through the gloom, searching for anything missed in the initial chaos. Borin found a cluster first, nestled in a cracked pedestal – a small cache of Celestial Orbs, numbering just **four**. Further along, near a collapsed archway, Kaelen unearthed a sealed lead box containing a larger collection – **twenty-one** of the glowing spheres. Elara, exploring a niche behind a crumbling statue, discovered a tightly packed grouping – precisely **six** Celestial Orbs. Deep within a narrow fissure, Borin called out again, having found another, distinct pocket – another **six** of the shimmering orbs. Kaelen then located a scattered trail leading to a hidden cavity; within lay **seven** Celestial Orbs, pulsing faintly. Finally, Elara found a large, ornate chest, mostly buried, which held a significant hoard – **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, their light muted by the ancient wood.\n\nThey gathered the discovered orbs, placing them carefully on a flat stone surface, the different quantities laid out before them. The light they cast was varied, some bright, others dim. They looked at the disparate piles, considering their meaning. They also remembered the power of **The Celestial Prime**, the immense energy they had just witnessed, a force that felt like a cornerstone to all these smaller findings.\n\n\"So many,\" Borin murmured, gesturing at the collections.\n\nKaelen knelt, his fingers hovering over the different groups. \"We have these... and the echoes of **The Celestial Prime**.\" His gaze settled on the group numbering **seven**. \"Look at these,\" he said softly. \"Compared to the others, these seem... centered. Balanced. Not the fewest, not the most, not clustered with the others of similar count. They feel like the pivot point, the still eye in the storm of all this rediscovered power.\"\n\nElara nodded slowly, her eyes fixed on the **seven** orbs. \"Yes,\" she breathed. \"The axis around which the others might turn. The core frequency.\"\n\nKaelen carefully picked up one of the **seven** orbs, its light steady and calm. \"This group,\" he declared, holding the single orb aloft, \"this is the **Celestial Axis**.\"\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2 (Explicit Result), Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number). Focus on: ensuring 'seven' appears exactly 1 time as a direct input description, and ensuring the operation's result is implied via 'Celestial Axis' without using the number 'seven' again to identify the result group.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) as a direct input but found 3 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous mentions of the number 'seven' (value: 7) were found. Rule 1.A only justifies 1 instance of 'seven' as an input. The additional 2 instances are not justified by Rule 1.A or a valid Rule 3 use, violating Rule 5.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'seven' (value: 7) was explicitly stated multiple times when identifying the group that represents the result ('Celestial Axis'). Rule 2 requires the numerical result to be implicit via 'Celestial Axis', not stated numerically, even though 'seven' is also a Rule 1.A input. The narrative should describe the single input group of seven and then identify the median group as 'Celestial Axis' without using the number 'seven' again in that context.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. Reduce the total mentions of 'seven' to exactly one (1). This single mention should occur when describing one of the input groups.    2. When identifying the group that represents the median result ('Celestial Axis'), refer to it conceptually or by its position relative to the other groups (e.g., 'this central group', 'the pivot point') but DO NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again in that context.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The beat text violates multiple rules regarding numerical frequency and the handling of the operation's result.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) as a direct input but found 3 time(s).

This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

Failure to adhere to these MEDIAN rules will result in rejection of your scene.", "generator_user_prompt": "Story Scene Task: Create the narrative for the step resulting in 'Celestial Axis' (Scene 3/8)\n\n**Background for Your Scene (Context for you, the writer - follow strict rules below for what appears in the story):**\n- Genre: High Fantasy / Adventure\n- Setting: A realm of floating islands connected by sky-bridges and airships, facing a returning ancient darkness.\n- Central Items in the Story: Celestial Orbs\n- Quantities from Previous Events (Conceptual Names & their values for your understanding - DO NOT use these values in the story): the concept known as 'The Celestial Prime' (which represents the numerical value 30)\n- New Numbers Introduced in this Scene (Values & their required frequencies for your understanding - Use word form in story, ALL must be mentioned with exact frequencies): 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27)\n\n**Your Scene's Core Action & Narrative Goal (Follow this closely):**\nThis scene needs to narrate an event or discovery that mirrors the mathematical operation: **median value**. The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow.

Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep.

This revision MUST meticulously address all issues identified by the validator below, while also re-adhering to ALL original rules for this scene. Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 2):**\n```text\nSlowly, they began to move, their boots crunching on fallen stone dust. The chamber was vast, its edges lost in shadow, but littered with the debris of ages. They split up, flash-lamps cutting swathes through the gloom, searching for anything missed in the initial chaos. Borin found a cluster first, nestled in a cracked pedestal – a small cache of Celestial Orbs, numbering just **four**. Further along, near a collapsed archway, Kaelen unearthed a sealed lead box containing a larger collection – **twenty-one** of the glowing spheres. Elara, exploring a niche behind a crumbling statue, discovered a tightly packed grouping – precisely **six** Celestial Orbs. Deep within a narrow fissure, Borin called out again, having found another, distinct pocket – another **six** of the shimmering orbs. Kaelen then located a scattered trail leading to a hidden cavity; within lay **seven** Celestial Orbs, pulsing faintly. Finally, Elara found a large, ornate chest, mostly buried, which held a significant hoard – **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, their light muted by the ancient wood.\n\nThey gathered the discovered orbs, placing them carefully on a flat stone surface, the different quantities laid out before them. The light they cast was varied, some bright, others dim. They looked at the disparate piles, considering their meaning. They also remembered the power of **The Celestial Prime**, the immense energy they had just witnessed, a force that felt like a cornerstone to all these smaller findings.\n\n\"So many,\" Borin murmured, gesturing at the collections.\n\nKaelen knelt, his fingers hovering over the different groups. \"We have these... and the echoes of **The Celestial Prime**.\" His gaze settled on the group they had found numbering **seven**. \"Look at these,\" he said softly. \"Compared to the others, this particular group seems... centered. Balanced. Not the fewest, not the most, not clustered with the others of similar count. They feel like the pivot point, the still eye in the storm of all this rediscovered power.\"\n\nElara nodded slowly, her eyes fixed on the group Kaelen indicated. \"Yes,\" she breathed. \"The axis around which the others might turn. The core frequency.\"\n\nKaelen carefully picked up one orb from that specific group, its light steady and calm. \"This group,\" he declared, holding the single orb aloft, \"this is the **Celestial Axis**.\"\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 2):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2 (Explicit Result). Focus on: exact counts for required inputs, ensuring result is implicit.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'seven' (value: 7) was explicitly stated (numbering seven) when identifying the median group, but should be implicit via 'Celestial Axis'. This second mention of 'seven' also contributes to the Rule 1.A frequency over-count.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the count for 'seven' and the Rule 2 violation, remove the explicit mention of \"numbering seven\" when Kaelen identifies the median group. The identification should rely on its position/characteristics relative to the other groups, leading to the conceptual name 'Celestial Axis', without using the number word 'seven' again. For example, rephrase Kaelen's line to something like: \"His gaze settled on that particular group. Look at these... Compared to the others, this group seems... centered. Balanced. Not the fewest, not the most, not clustered with the others of similar count. They feel like the pivot point...\"\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The generated beat text violates multiple rules from the Generator's Writing Guide.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Prime') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Celestial Orbs'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'Celestial Axis') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-eight').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-eight' (28) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Star's Eye' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-eight' (28) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' and NOT restate 'twenty-eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark.

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A.

The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation.

Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here.

This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.

Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-eight' (28)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Celestial Orbs'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'Celestial Axis') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-eight').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-eight' (28) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Star's Eye' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-eight' (28) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' and NOT restate 'twenty-eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark.

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A.

Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*.

Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.

Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-eight' (28)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Celestial Orbs'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'Celestial Axis') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-eight').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-eight' (28) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Star's Eye' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-eight' (28) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' and NOT restate 'twenty-eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark.

The phrase: 'They stood amidst the disparate discoveries, the faint gleam of the smaller finds paling beside the sheer power radiating from the two largest caches. Of all the orbs unearthed, the magnitude of these final two finds was undeniable.' This sentence uses the number 'two' to refer to the number of largest groups found, which is a form of re-listing/summarizing the inputs rather than introducing a new input quantity.    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous number 'two' (value: 2) was found in the phrase 'two largest caches' / 'final two finds'. This instance of 'two' is not justified as a Rule 1.A input (it does not represent a group of 2 orbs being introduced) and is not among the numbers permitted for general phrasing by Rule 3 for this beat.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-eight' (28)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark.

Please re-read ALL rules carefully.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To strictly comply with Rule 4, the number 'seventeen' (value: 17) must be removed from the text. Note that removing 'seventeen' would then cause a violation of Rule 1.A, which requires 'seventeen' exactly one time.

This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-eight' (28)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'Celestial Axis') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

A profound stillness settled around them, broken only by the faint, rhythmic sound of their own passage, drawing them further into the mountain's unyielding heart. They rounded a bend, and the lantern light caught a faint shimmer. Nestled in a small hollow were **two** Celestial Orbs, their light muted. Further along, in a narrow fissure, they found **four** more, glowing with a slightly brighter intensity.

Before them, in a crystalline formation, was a truly immense concentration of **twenty-eight** Celestial Orbs, their brilliance almost overwhelming. And as if the mountain itself wished to test their resolve, a hidden passage nearby opened into a smaller grotto, holding yet another equally vast collection – **twenty-eight** more of the radiant orbs. They stood amidst the disparate discoveries, the faint gleam of the smaller finds paling beside the sheer power radiating from the largest caches. They focused their attention on one, its singular, overwhelming power marking it as the most significant discovery. This, they knew, was the heart of the mountain's secret, the preeminent find.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Celestial Orbs'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'Celestial Axis') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-eight').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-eight' (28) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Star's Eye' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-eight' (28) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' and NOT restate 'twenty-eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark.

Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-eight' (28)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Celestial Orbs'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'Celestial Axis') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-eight').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-eight' (28) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Star's Eye' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-eight' (28) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' and NOT restate 'twenty-eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark.

SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark.

Elara trailed a hand along the damp, rough-hewn wall beside her, feeling the mountain's immense, silent presence.

A profound stillness settled around them, broken only by the faint, rhythmic sound of their own passage, drawing them further into the mountain's unyielding heart.\n\nThey followed a narrow, winding passage that opened into a vast cavern, its ceiling lost in shadow. Around the cavern's edge, in scattered depressions and on rocky shelves, lay the objects of their quest. Borin raised the lantern, its beam sweeping across the space.\n\n\"Look,\" Elara whispered, pointing. In a shallow depression near the entrance lay a small cluster of **two** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces gleaming faintly even in the low light.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-eight' (28)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c.

A profound stillness settled around them, broken only by the faint, rhythmic sound of their own passage, drawing them further into the mountain's unyielding heart.\n\nThey followed a narrow, winding passage that opened into a vast cavern, its ceiling lost in shadow. Around the cavern's edge, in scattered depressions and on rocky shelves, lay the objects of their quest. Borin raised the lantern, its beam sweeping across the space.\n\n\"Look,\" Elara whispered, pointing. In a shallow depression near the entrance lay a small cluster of **two** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces gleaming faintly even in the low light. Further along, on a jagged ledge, was a slightly larger grouping of **four**. Kaelen moved carefully towards a wider alcove, finding a scattered collection of **eight** Celestial Orbs spread across the dusty floor.\n\nTheir search continued, revealing more. Within a crumbling section of the far wall, they uncovered a discovery of **seventeen** Celestial Orbs, nestled together as if hidden deliberately long ago. Deeper in the cavern, near a pool of still, dark water, they found a significant deposit of **twenty-eight** Celestial Orbs, their combined glow casting an ethereal light. Moving into a side chamber they hadn't noticed before, Borin's lantern illuminated a second, equally large hoard of **twenty-eight** Celestial Orbs, filling a natural basin in the rock. Elara's breath hitched as she spotted an impressive cache holding **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs tucked beneath a rocky overhang.\n\nThey surveyed the different findings. Compared to the lesser quantities, these larger concentrations pulsed with undeniable power, dwarfing even the memory of the **Celestial Axis**. The energy radiating from the most potent of these caches was overwhelming, a clear focal point among all they had uncovered. This preeminent quantity, this heart of power they had sought, was clearly paramount. They knew this was it.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Celestial Orbs' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'eight' (8), 'ten' (10), 'nine' (9), 'twenty-four' (24), 'nine' (9); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Star's Eye'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Celestial Orbs' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Star's Eye') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'ten' (10), 'nine' (9), 'twenty-four' (24), 'nine' (9) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Celestial Key' (representing the value 'eight'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'eight' (8) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Celestial Key' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'eight' (8) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Celestial Key' and NOT restate 'eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'nine' (9) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'ten' (10) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'eight' (8) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Key' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eight' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eight' is the outcome (i.e., the sum modulo 10). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Celestial Key', you MUST NOT use the word 'eight' or the digit '8' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eight Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Celestial Key') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - SM - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Celestial Key.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Celestial Key represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Celestial Key'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Star's Eye'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...e and something else, something wild and untamed. Elara closed her eyes for a moment, letting the cavern's pulse resonate through her, a deep, slow beat that felt older than time itself. Borin sighed softly beside her, a sound lost almost instantly in the profound quiet, his gaze still fixed on the source of the light, a silent reverence in his posture. Kaelen remained a still, watchful presence, his attention sharp, scanning the edges of the chamber where the light failed and the true darkness began. Each breath they took felt deliberate, loud in the stillness, a fragile counterpoint to the immense, silent power that filled the space. The shadows danced, not randomly, but with a strange, almost purposeful grace, as if they were living things, observing them in turn. A chill, not of cold but of immense age, settled upon their skin.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Celestial Orbs' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'eight' (8), 'ten' (10), 'nine' (9), 'twenty-four' (24), 'nine' (9); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Star's Eye'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Celestial Orbs' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Star's Eye') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'ten' (10), 'nine' (9), 'twenty-four' (24), 'nine' (9) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Celestial Key' (representing the value 'eight'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'eight' (8) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Celestial Key' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'eight' (8) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Celestial Key' and NOT restate 'eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'nine' (9) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'ten' (10) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'eight' (8) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Key' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eight' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eight' is the outcome (i.e., the sum modulo 10). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Celestial Key', you MUST NOT use the word 'eight' or the digit '8' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eight Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Celestial Key') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - SM - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Celestial Key.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Celestial Key represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Celestial Key'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Star's Eye'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...e and something else, something wild and untamed. Elara closed her eyes for a moment, letting the cavern's pulse resonate through her, a deep, slow beat that felt older than time itself. Borin sighed softly beside her, a sound lost almost instantly in the profound quiet, his gaze still fixed on the source of the light, a silent reverence in his posture. Kaelen remained a still, watchful presence, his attention sharp, scanning the edges of the chamber where the light failed and the true darkness began. Each breath they took felt deliberate, loud in the stillness, a fragile counterpoint to the immense, silent power that filled the space. The shadows danced, not randomly, but with a strange, almost purposeful grace, as if they were living things, observing them in turn. A chill, not of cold but of immense age, settled upon their skin.

Elara broke the spell, her voice a low murmur. \"We must gather them. All of them.\" She gestured towards the glowing core of the chamber, where the energy of 'The Star's Eye' pulsed. Carefully, reverently, they began the process. From a hidden niche in the rock face, Borin retrieved a cluster of **eight** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces cool despite the ambient warmth. Kaelen, examining a crystalline growth near the chamber's edge, discovered a vein containing **ten** more, embedded like luminous jewels. Elara herself located a small, intricately carved box holding **nine** orbs, their light muted but steady. Deeper within the chamber, almost hidden by shadow, lay a larger cache – a spill of **twenty-four** orbs, scattered across a natural pedestal. Finally, tucked into a high, narrow fissure, they found another group of **nine** orbs, nestled together.\n\nAs each quantity was added to the area around 'The Star's Eye', the chamber's resonance intensified. The individual lights merged, swirling into a single, blinding vortex of energy. It didn't simply grow brighter; it began to cycle, to pulse with an intricate, internal rhythm. Elara raised the focusing crystal, directing the chaotic energy onto a flat, ancient stone. The light settled, forming a dynamic pattern that shifted and reformed continuously. It was a complex, fluid dance, a visual representation of the energy's core nature. Kaelen leaned closer, his eyes sharp. \"Look,\" he said, pointing. \"The full cosmic pulse contains ten distinct moments, yes, but the fundamental pattern, the repeating core essence... it manifests as a sequence of eight distinct phases before it begins anew.\" Borin nodded slowly, a look of profound understanding dawning on his face.

This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Star's Eye'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'eight' (8)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Key'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Star's Eye') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Elara broke the spell, her voice a low murmur. \"We must gather them. All of them.\" She gestured towards the glowing core of the chamber, where the energy of 'The Star's Eye' pulsed. Carefully, reverently, they began the process. From a hidden niche in the rock face, Borin retrieved a cluster of **eight** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces cool despite the ambient warmth. Kaelen, examining a crystalline growth near the chamber's edge, discovered a vein containing **ten** more, embedded like luminous jewels. Elara herself located a small, intricately carved box holding **nine** orbs, their light muted but steady. Deeper within the chamber, almost hidden by shadow, lay a larger cache – a spill of **twenty-four** orbs, scattered across a natural pedestal. Finally, tucked into a high, narrow fissure, they found another group of **nine** orbs, nestled together.\n\nAs each quantity was added to the area around 'The Star's Eye', the chamber's resonance intensified. The individual lights merged, swirling into a single, blinding vortex of energy. It didn't simply grow brighter; it began to cycle, to pulse with an intricate, internal rhythm. Elara raised the focusing crystal, directing the chaotic energy onto a flat, ancient stone. The light settled, forming a dynamic pattern that shifted and reformed continuously. It was a complex, fluid dance, a visual representation of the energy's core nature. Kaelen leaned closer, his eyes sharp. \"Look,\" he said, pointing. \"The full cosmic pulse contains ten distinct moments, yes, but the fundamental pattern, the repeating core essence... it manifests as a sequence of eight distinct phases before it begins anew.\" Borin nodded slowly, a look of profound understanding dawning on his face. This repeating sequence, this fundamental rhythm, this was the essence they sought. This was the heart of the chamber's power.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Celestial Orbs' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'eight' (8), 'ten' (10), 'nine' (9), 'twenty-four' (24), 'nine' (9); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Star's Eye'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Celestial Orbs' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Star's Eye') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'ten' (10), 'nine' (9), 'twenty-four' (24), 'nine' (9) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Celestial Key' (representing the value 'eight'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'eight' (8) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Celestial Key' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'eight' (8) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Celestial Key' and NOT restate 'eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'nine' (9) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'ten' (10) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'eight' (8) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Key' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eight' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eight' is the outcome (i.e., the sum modulo 10). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Celestial Key', you MUST NOT use the word 'eight' or the digit '8' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eight Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Celestial Key') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - SM - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Celestial Key.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Celestial Key represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Celestial Key'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Star's Eye'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...e and something else, something wild and untamed. Elara closed her eyes for a moment, letting the cavern's pulse resonate through her, a deep, slow beat that felt older than time itself. Borin sighed softly beside her, a sound lost almost instantly in the profound quiet, his gaze still fixed on the source of the light, a silent reverence in his posture. Kaelen remained a still, watchful presence, his attention sharp, scanning the edges of the chamber where the light failed and the true darkness began. Each breath they took felt deliberate, loud in the stillness, a fragile counterpoint to the immense, silent power that filled the space. The shadows danced, not randomly, but with a strange, almost purposeful grace, as if they were living things, observing them in turn. A chill, not of cold but of immense age, settled upon their skin.

Elara broke the spell, her voice a low murmur. \"We must gather them. All of them.\" She gestured towards the glowing core of the chamber, where the energy of 'The Star's Eye' pulsed. Carefully, reverently, they began the process. From a hidden niche in the rock face, Borin retrieved a cluster of **eight** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces cool despite the ambient warmth. Kaelen, examining a crystalline growth near the chamber's edge, discovered a vein containing **ten** more, embedded like luminous jewels. Elara herself located a small, intricately carved box holding **nine** orbs, their light muted but steady. Deeper within the chamber, almost hidden by shadow, lay a larger cache – a spill of **twenty-four** orbs, scattered across a natural pedestal. Finally, tucked into a high, narrow fissure, they found another group of **nine** orbs, nestled together.\n\nAs each quantity was added to the area around 'The Star's Eye', the chamber's resonance intensified. The individual lights merged, swirling into a single, blinding vortex of energy. It didn't simply grow brighter; it began to cycle, to pulse with an intricate, internal rhythm. Elara raised the focusing crystal, directing the chaotic energy onto a flat, ancient stone. The light settled, forming a dynamic pattern that shifted and reformed continuously. It was a complex, fluid dance, a visual representation of the energy's core nature. Kaelen leaned closer, his eyes sharp. \"Look,\" he said, pointing. \"The full cosmic pulse contains ten distinct moments, yes, but the fundamental pattern, the repeating core essence... it manifests as a sequence of eight distinct phases before it begins anew.\" Borin nodded slowly, a look of profound understanding dawning on his face. This repeating sequence, this fundamental rhythm, this was the essence they sought. This was the heart of the chamber's power. This, they knew, was 'The Celestial Key'.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2 (Explicit Result), Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number). Focus on: ensuring exact counts for required inputs ('eight' 1 time, 'ten' 1 time), ensuring the result ('eight') is implied via 'The Celestial Key' and not explicitly stated, and removing extraneous numbers like the second mention of 'ten'.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'eight' (value: 8) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count. The first mention ('eight Celestial Orbs') fulfills the input requirement. The second mention ('eight distinct phases') is extraneous to the input count.    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'ten' (value: 10) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count. The first mention ('ten more') fulfills the input requirement. The second mention ('ten distinct moments') is extraneous to the input count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'eight' (value: 8) was explicitly stated ('eight distinct phases') when identifying 'The Celestial Key'. Rule 2 requires the result to be implied, not stated, even though 'eight' is also a Rule 1.A input. The 1 required mention of 'eight' is for the input quantity only.    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous number 'ten' (value: 10) was found in the phrase 'ten distinct moments'. This mention is not justified by Rule 1.A (as it's an over-count for the input) or a valid Rule 3 use (as 'ten' is not listed in Rule 3), and thus violates Rule 5.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. Remove the phrase 'ten distinct moments' to fix the Rule 1.A frequency over-count for 'ten' and the Rule 5 violation.    2. Rephrase the description of 'The Celestial Key' to imply the value 'eight' without using the word 'eight'. For example, instead of 'it manifests as a sequence of eight distinct phases', describe a characteristic or property of the pattern that corresponds to the value eight, or simply state 'This repeating sequence... This, they knew, was 'The Celestial Key'' after describing the pattern's nature without quantifying it numerically.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The generated beat text violates multiple rules from the Generator's Writing Guide.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'eight' (value: 8) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'nine' (9) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'ten' (10) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'eight' (8) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Key' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eight' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eight' is the outcome (i.e., the sum modulo 10). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Celestial Key', you MUST NOT use the word 'eight' or the digit '8' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eight Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Celestial Key') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - SM - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Celestial Key.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Celestial Key represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Celestial Key'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Star's Eye'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A.

Elara broke the spell, her voice a low murmur. \"We must gather them. All of them.\" She gestured towards the glowing core of the chamber, where the energy of 'The Star's Eye' pulsed. Carefully, reverently, they began the process. From a hidden niche in the rock face, Borin retrieved a cluster of **eight** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces cool despite the ambient warmth. Kaelen, examining a crystalline growth near the chamber's edge, discovered a vein containing **ten** more, embedded like luminous jewels. Elara herself located a small, intricately carved box holding **nine** orbs, their light muted but steady. Deeper within the chamber, almost hidden by shadow, lay a larger cache – a spill of **twenty-four** orbs, scattered across a natural pedestal. Finally, tucked into a high, narrow fissure, they found another group of **nine** orbs, nestled together.\n\nAs each quantity was added to the area around 'The Star's Eye', the chamber's resonance intensified. The individual lights merged, swirling into a single, blinding vortex of energy. It didn't simply grow brighter; it began to cycle, to pulse with an intricate, internal rhythm. Elara raised the focusing crystal, directing the chaotic energy onto a flat, ancient stone. The light settled, forming a dynamic pattern that shifted and reformed continuously. It was a complex, fluid dance, a visual representation of the energy's core nature. Kaelen leaned closer, his eyes sharp. \"Look,\" he said, pointing. \"The fundamental pattern, the repeating core essence... it reveals itself in the cycle.\" Borin nodded slowly, a look of profound understanding dawning on his face. This repeating sequence, this fundamental rhythm, this was the essence they sought. This was the heart of the chamber's power. This, they knew, was 'The Celestial Key'.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Celestial Orbs'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-eight' (28), 'five' (5), 'eight' (8), 'twenty-two' (22), 'nineteen' (19)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'The Celestial Key'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Key') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-eight' (28), 'five' (5), 'eight' (8), 'twenty-two' (22), 'nineteen' (19) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Aetherial Prime'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-eight').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-eight' (28) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Aetherial Prime' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-eight' (28) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Aetherial Prime' and NOT restate 'twenty-eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-two' (22): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'eight' (8) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-two' (22) and 'twenty-eight' (28). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Aetherial Prime' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Aetherial Prime', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Aetherial Prime') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Aetherial Prime.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Aetherial Prime represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Aetherial Prime'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Key'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air grew heavy and still, carrying the chill of ages past. Kaelen's lamp cast only a small, flickering circle of defiance against the absolute blackness that pressed in from all sides, revealing nothing but the same slick, unyielding stone.

Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-eight').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-eight' (28) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Aetherial Prime' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-eight' (28) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Aetherial Prime' and NOT restate 'twenty-eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-two' (22): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'eight' (8) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-two' (22) and 'twenty-eight' (28). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Aetherial Prime' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Aetherial Prime', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Aetherial Prime') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Aetherial Prime.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Aetherial Prime represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Aetherial Prime'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Key'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air grew heavy and still, carrying the chill of ages past.

For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-eight' (28)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Aetherial Prime'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Key') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met. False otherwise.\n\n-   **`explanation_for_generator` (string):**\n    *   If invalid, provide a DETAILED, step-by-step explanation of ALL violations found. Reference specific rule numbers from the Generator's Writing Guide.\n    *   **CRITICAL: For each violation, be specific about the number(s) involved and the nature of the error.**\n    *   *Use these exact phrases for common errors when applicable:*\n        *   \"VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Missing): Required number '[number_word]' (value: [value]), expected [X] time(s), was completely missing.\"\n        *   \"VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number '[number_word]' (value: [value]) was required [X] time(s) but found [Y] time(s). This is an [over-count/under-count].\"\n        *   \"VIOLATION Rule 1.B (Re-listing): Detected a phrase that re-lists/summarizes input numbers, likely causing frequency errors for Rule 1.A. The phrase: '[quote the problematic phrase]'.\"\n        *   \"VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result '[result_word]' (value: [value]) was explicitly stated but should be implicit via 'The Aetherial Prime'. (If it was also a Rule 1.A input, clarify if the issue is an *additional* statement as the result).\"\n        *   \"VIOLATION Rule 3 (Phrasing/Arity Misuse): Number '[number_word]' (value: [value]) was used. This is invalid because: [e.g., 'it was also a Rule 1.A input', 'it is forbidden by Rule 4', 'it is not the correct arity (6)', 'it is not among the allowed phrasing numbers for this beat as per Rule 3', 'its use was not sparing/essential'].

Kaelen's lamp cast only a small, flickering circle of defiance against the absolute blackness that pressed in from all sides, revealing nothing but the same slick, unyielding stone. The silence here was not an absence of sound, but a tangible presence, broken only by the soft scrape of their boots and the steady rhythm of their breathing. Elara's hand remained a quiet comfort on his arm, a warm point in the pervasive cold. Behind them, Borin's solid form was a bulwark against the encroaching dark, his presence a quiet strength. They moved as a single entity through the deep, the world above feeling impossibly distant, utterly forgotten in the profound, ancient quiet of the earth's heart.\n\nSuddenly, the oppressive darkness seemed to thin, replaced by a faint, internal luminescence. Ahead, the passage widened into a series of small alcoves carved into the living rock. Within the first, nestled on a shelf of crystal, pulsed the soft light of **five** Celestial Orbs. They moved to the next, where a different arrangement of **eight** Celestial Orbs rested in a shallow basin of water that mirrored their glow. Further in, a deeper recess held a cluster of **nineteen** Celestial Orbs, their combined light creating a gentle warmth in the cool air. Across the way, suspended in a web of fine, metallic threads, hung **twenty-two** Celestial Orbs, shimmering like captured stars. Finally, the largest alcove opened into a small grotto, and there, filling the space with an intense, vibrant radiance, lay **twenty-eight** Celestial Orbs, their energy palpable even from a distance.\n\nThey stood before the collection of discoveries, their eyes drawn inevitably to the grotto. The power emanating from that final, largest group was undeniable, dwarfing the energies of the others. Kaelen stepped forward, his lamp now unnecessary in the face of the Orbs' brilliance. \"Look,\" he breathed, his voice echoing slightly in the space. \"Compared to this, even The Celestial Key feels like a whisper against a storm.\" Elara nodded, her gaze fixed on the radiant cluster. \"This concentration... this is the heartwood we sought.\" Borin placed a hand on Kaelen's shoulder, his voice low and resonant. \"This is the culmination. This supreme quantity... we shall name it The Aetherial Prime.\"\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nImagine your characters are gathering or combining distinct collections of 'Celestial Orbs'. Some of these collections might be newly found or counted, corresponding to the numbers (and their frequencies): 'twenty' (20), 'one' (1), 'nineteen' (19). Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Aetherial Prime'. Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Aetherial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty' (20), 'one' (1), 'nineteen' (19) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Astral Core'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('sixty-eight') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixty-eight' (68) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Astral Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'one' (1): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty' (20): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'one' (1) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty' (20). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'sixty-eight' (68) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Astral Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-two' (22), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Aetherial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The last vestiges of the strange light retreated entirely, leaving the chamber cloaked in the deep, natural gloom of the underground.

Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'one' (1) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty' (20). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'sixty-eight' (68) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Astral Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-two' (22), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Aetherial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The last vestiges of the strange light retreated entirely, leaving the chamber cloaked in the deep, natural gloom of the underground.

Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nImagine your characters are gathering or combining distinct collections of 'Celestial Orbs'. Some of these collections might be newly found or counted, corresponding to the numbers (and their frequencies): 'eighteen' (18), 'eight' (8), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirty' (30). Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Astral Core'. Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Astral Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'eight' (8), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirty' (30) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Heart'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred forty') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred forty' (140) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Celestial Heart' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred forty' (140) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Heart' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-two' (22), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Astral Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They stood for a moment, letting the sheer scale of the chamber wash over them.

Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred forty' (140) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Heart' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-two' (22), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Astral Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one hundred forty' (140)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Heart'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (5).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Astral Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred forty' (140) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Heart' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-two' (22), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Astral Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They stood for a moment, letting the sheer scale of the chamber wash over them. The lamp's meager glow struggled against the vastness, illuminating only a small circle around their feet and the lower reaches of the colossal pillars that held the roof aloft.

A quiet sigh escaped parched lips. Beside them, a hand rested lightly on a weapon hilt, a silent acknowledgment of the tension that hummed beneath the silence.

Focus on removing all instances of the forbidden number 'one' (and words implying 'one' like 'single'). Ensure only numbers explicitly allowed by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) or valid Rule 3 uses (not forbidden by Rule 4) are present.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - General Adherence Issue: The validator indicated issues. Full explanation: \"The beat is invalid due to violations of Rule 4 and Rule 5. Rule 4 strictly forbids mentioning the number 'one' (1) in any form. The text uses the word 'one' in the phrase \"One by one\" (appearing twice) and implies 'one' with the word \"single\" in \"largest single discovery\" (appearing once). This results in the forbidden number 'one' appearing 3 times. Rule 5 states that no other numerical values should be introduced beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4. Since 'one' is forbidden by Rule 4, its use is not permitted under Rule 3 and thus constitutes an extraneous number violating Rule 5.\". Please re-read ALL rules carefully.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. Remove or rephrase the sentence containing \"One by one\" to avoid using the forbidden number 'one'. For example, instead of \"One by one, with reverence and care...\", consider phrasing like \"With reverence and care, all the gathered orbs...\".    2. Remove or rephrase the phrase \"largest single discovery\" to avoid implying the forbidden number 'one'. For example, instead of \"was the largest single discovery yet: thirty Celestial Orbs\", consider phrasing like \"was the largest discovery yet: thirty Celestial Orbs\" or \"was a large discovery: thirty Celestial Orbs\".\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The beat is invalid due to violations of Rule 4 and Rule 5.

Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one hundred forty' (140)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Heart'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (5).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Astral Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The lamp beam finally caught on something – a faint luminescence emanating from a recess in the stone. Carefully, they approached. Nested within a crystalline growth were Celestial Orbs, their light soft and steady. They counted them, finding **eighteen** nestled there. A quiet murmur of success passed between them.\n\nFurther exploration revealed another pocket, tucked behind a fallen section of masonry. This cache held a smaller collection, only **eight** of the glowing spheres, but each pulsed with potent energy. They gathered these as well, adding them to the growing collection.\n\nThe path led onward, past more silent pillars, until they reached a shallow pool of still, dark water. Submerged just beneath the surface, visible through the clear liquid, lay another group. Patiently, they retrieved these, discovering there were **sixteen** orbs resting in the watery cradle.\n\nFinally, near the center of the vast chamber, they found a pedestal, seemingly empty at first glance. But a hidden mechanism, triggered by a pressure plate, caused a section of the floor to slide open, revealing a deep vault. Within, resting on a bed of fine, ancient sand, was the largest discovery yet: **thirty** Celestial Orbs, their combined radiance almost blinding in the darkness.\n\nWith these new acquisitions secured, they carefully brought forth the container holding The Astral Core, the result of their previous arduous journey. With reverence and care, all the gathered orbs – the newly found groups and the revered Astral Core itself – were combined into a magnificent accumulation on the central pedestal. As the last orb settled into place, the chamber filled with a profound, resonant light, a unified pulse of power that seemed to beat in time with their own hearts. This potent, unified collection, radiating with immense energy, was now known to them as The Celestial Heart.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

Lyra Meadowlight knelt by the lip of the floating island, the damp stone cool beneath her palms. Below, nothing but the endless, churning grey. Above, the faint, ethereal glow of Sky-gems pulsed within the rocky crust, their light muted by the pervasive fog. They were the lifeblood of these scattered lands, their slow, steady thrum a constant presence.\n\nA soft footstep sounded behind her. Lyra turned to see Sister Agnes approaching, her kindly face etched with a familiar, unsettling worry. The village healer's eyes, usually warm, held a distant, troubled look.\n\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\n\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister. More hesitant.\"\n\nSister Agnes knelt beside her, her gaze following Lyra's. A sigh escaped her lips, thin and weary. \"They are. The light fades across all the islands. A creeping chill takes hold.\" She paused, her fingers tracing a pattern on the damp stone. \"We cannot simply wait. The old ways speak of places where the light burns brighter, where the gems are born in abundance.\"\n\nShe looked at Lyra, her eyes holding a plea, a silent question. \"A journey must be made. A perilous path across the mist-shrouded void, seeking the heart of the light before it is extinguished entirely.\" The air seemed to grow colder, the faint pulse of the Sky-gems nearby seeming weaker than before. The need was clear, the destination unknown, and the path fraught with unseen dangers lurking in the grey depths.\n\nThe mist swirled thicker as Lyra and Sister Agnes stepped onto the crumbling stone circle. The air here felt different, heavy with the scent of damp rock and something else, something ancient and dormant. This chamber was a 'place of abundance' the old texts spoke of, though it seemed long forgotten. They moved with quiet purpose, their eyes scanning the shadowed alcoves and fissures in the rock.\n\nIn a small, almost hidden niche, Lyra spotted a cluster of gems, their light a soft, steady pulse. She counted them carefully: there were **five** Sky-gems nestled together. Further into the chamber, Sister Agnes pointed towards a larger vein running across the ceiling; embedded within it were precisely **ten** gleaming stones. Deeper still, in a collapsed section, they unearthed another collection, numbering **eleven** in total.\n\nTheir search led them to a narrow passage where the air grew colder. Here, clinging to the damp walls, they found **seventeen** gems, their glow faint but persistent. A larger, central cavern yielded the most impressive find yet, a shimmering deposit containing **twenty-one** Sky-gems. Finally, near the chamber's exit, almost overlooked, was a scattering of **twenty-three** stones, their light diffused across the floor.\n\nThey paused, looking at the various sources they had discovered. Each held a different intensity, a different presence. They needed to understand the core, the fundamental spark that fueled the greater light. Their gaze settled upon the smallest, most contained cluster. It was here, in this humble gathering, that they felt the purest, most concentrated essence of the light's potential. This, they knew, was not just a collection of gems; it was the fundamental flicker, the origin point they sought. They designated this specific discovery as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey knelt before the smallest gathering of light, the air around it thrumming with a silent energy. The gems pulsed gently, casting intricate shadows that danced across the rough stone walls. Lyra felt a profound sense of connection, as if the very essence of the cavern breathed through these stones. Sister Agnes closed her eyes for a moment, absorbing the quiet power, a serene expression settling upon her features. This was more than just a find; it was a revelation, a glimpse into the fundamental nature of the light itself. The echoing silence of the deep earth seemed to hold its breath, witnessing this moment of understanding.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe soft, pulsing light from the cluster of gems cast long, dancing shadows across the rough cavern walls. The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and ancient stone, seemed to hold its breath, reverent and still. Lyra felt the profound quiet settle deep within her, a sense of peace washing over the earlier tension of their descent. Sister Agnes remained kneeling, her head bowed slightly, a faint smile gracing her lips as if communing with the very essence of the light. The gems hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the core of their beings, a fundamental truth revealed in the deep dark. They lingered in the glow, letting the quiet energy seep into their weary forms, a silent acknowledgment passing between them in the sacred space.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe gentle pulse of the gems continued its silent song. Lyra watched the light dance, mesmerized by the shifting patterns on the ancient stone. The air felt cooler now, carrying the faint, clean scent of deep rock. Sister Agnes slowly rose from her knees, her movements quiet and deliberate. A soft sigh escaped her lips, a sound of contentment rather than weariness. Her eyes, reflecting the gem light, held a deep, peaceful glow. They stood together in the luminous heart of the cavern, letting the profound stillness wrap around them like a cloak. The world beyond this radiant chamber felt distant, irrelevant, lost in the quiet hum of the earth's hidden energy.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe gem-light pulsed, painting the cavern walls with shifting hues of emerald and sapphire. Dust motes danced in the radiant beams, tiny specks caught in the silent, ancient energy. Lyra felt the stillness settle deep within her bones, a quiet counterpoint to the world she knew above. Sister Agnes remained beside her, a calm presence radiating peace. The air, cool and pure, carried the faint scent of damp stone and something older, something elemental. A shared breath hung between them, unspoken understanding passing in the luminous glow. The path ahead, though unseen from this radiant heart, beckoned softly, a whispered call from the shadowed tunnels beyond the light's reach.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe vibrant pulse of the gem subsided, leaving a softer, persistent luminescence that painted the cavern walls in hues of deep green and twilight blue. The profound stillness remained, a sacred hush that pressed gently against the ears. Lyra breathed deeply, the scent of damp stone and forgotten ages filling her lungs. A sense of peace, fragile yet profound, settled within her. Beside her, Sister Agnes stood like a silent sentinel, her presence a comforting anchor. Their shared moment in the light faded as they turned, their gazes drawn to the mouth of a shadowed passage where the light did not reach. The air shifted, becoming cooler, carrying the faint, earthy smell of the deep tunnels that lay ahead, waiting.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe gentle light of the chamber receded behind them, leaving the passage ahead in absolute shadow. It was not merely dark, but a palpable absence of light, a hungry void that seemed to absorb even the faint luminescence clinging to their clothes. The air here was heavy, damp, and colder than the cavern they had just left, carrying the unmistakable scent of deep, undisturbed earth and mineral deposits. Lyra felt a prickle of apprehension crawl across her skin, a primal unease at the unknown that lay hidden within the unyielding blackness. Beside her, Sister Agnes was a silent, steady presence, her breathing calm, her gaze fixed on the entrance as if peering into the very heart of the mountain. The silence between them was complete, a shared acknowledgment of the daunting path that awaited, shrouded in mystery and the promise of what lay beneath the world they knew.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe oppressive darkness of the passage clung to them, thick and absolute. Lyra moved cautiously, her hand brushing against the rough-hewn stone of the wall. Sister Agnes followed, her presence a quiet anchor in the void. The air grew colder, carrying the faint, metallic tang of deep earth. As they ventured deeper, a faint luminescence began to pierce the gloom – the soft, internal light of Sky-gems embedded in the rock.\n\nNear the entrance of a narrow side tunnel, Lyra spotted a small cluster, their light barely visible through a thin layer of dust. Carefully, she extracted **six** Sky-gems. Further along the main passage, where the ceiling dipped low, Sister Agnes pointed out another cache hidden in a crystalline growth; they gathered **nine** from this find. The passage widened into a small grotto, and scattered across the floor, almost like fallen stars, lay **fifteen** more.\n\nPushing deeper into the mountain's heart, they discovered a rich vein running through the rock face. From this, they meticulously collected **eighteen** Sky-gems. In a parallel shaft, accessed through a low crawlspace, another significant deposit was found, yielding a further **eighteen**. A small, intricate pocket within the rock revealed **nineteen** gems, nestled together like luminous eggs. Finally, entering a vast, echoing cavern, they beheld a massive geode pulsing with soft light, from which they harvested **twenty-six** magnificent Sky-gems.\n\nWith reverent care, they brought these newly gathered treasures together. They also added the precious collection known only as The Sky-gem's Spark, which they had guarded since their journey began. All were placed upon a large, flat stone at the cavern's center. As the distinct groups of gems settled together, their individual lights merged, swirling into a unified radiance that pulsed with immense, contained power. This radiant, combined mass became known, from that moment forth, as The Celestial Core.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe vast cavern breathed with the new light. The Celestial Core pulsed upon the stone, a contained star banishing the ancient darkness that had held sway. Lyra watched its steady beat, a deep weariness settling alongside a quiet, profound reverence. Sister Agnes knelt nearby, her face bathed in the soft radiance, her lips moving in silent contemplation. The air felt different now, charged with a potential that spoke not of endings, but of a path yet to unfold. The silence of the deep earth held their breath, awaiting the next step of their quest.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air in the cavern hummed with a vibrant, new energy. The harsh edges of the stone softened in the pervasive glow of the Celestial Core, revealing veins of crystal that had long been hidden in shadow. A deep, resonant silence settled over the space, broken only by the gentle pulse of the light itself. Lyra closed her eyes for a moment, letting the warmth seep into her weary bones, the profound quiet a balm after the trials they had faced. Sister Agnes stood nearby, her face serene, a silent prayer upon her lips. The oppressive weight of the deep earth seemed to recede, replaced by a feeling of potent possibility. They were poised at the edge of something vast, the path forward illuminated by the heart of the mountain itself.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe luminous heart of the mountain pulsed with a gentle rhythm, casting its ethereal glow across the vast chamber. Every facet of crystal, every curve of ancient rock, was bathed in a light that felt both warm and invigorating. The oppressive chill of the deep earth was replaced by a comforting warmth, and the air itself seemed to shimmer with latent energy. Lyra met Sister Agnes's eyes across the glowing expanse, a shared look acknowledging the profound shift in the atmosphere. The silence was no longer heavy but expectant, filled with the quiet hum of the core and the soft echo of their own breathing. This place, moments ago a daunting challenge, now felt like a sacred space, a promise whispered in light.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe luminous heart deepened its pulse, the golden light warming to a profound amber that seeped into every crevice of the crystalline walls. Shadows lengthened and swayed like silent dancers across the floor of polished rock. A subtle current, warm and inviting, seemed to flow from the core, a gentle urging against their skin. Lyra felt it, a soft hum resonating deep within her bones. Across the radiant expanse, Sister Agnes offered a small, rare smile, her eyes reflecting the chamber's brilliance. The silence that had been expectant now felt like a shared breath, held in reverence. They stepped forward together, drawn by the irresistible call of the light.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey moved deeper into the heart of the light. The air grew warmer, thick with the scent of ozone and something ancient, like sun-baked stone mixed with fresh rain. The amber glow pulsed steadily now, painting long, dancing shadows that stretched and contracted with each beat. Crystalline formations jutted from the walls, catching the light and shattering it into shimmering fragments that danced across the floor. Lyra felt the hum deepen, a resonance that seemed to align her very being with the chamber's core. Beside her, Sister Agnes's presence was a quiet anchor, their shared wonder a silent language. The silence was profound, broken only by the gentle thrum of the chamber's heart and the soft sound of their steps on the polished rock. They walked towards the source, drawn by an unseen force, their path illuminated by the radiant core.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe polished rock beneath their boots felt smooth, almost warm through the worn leather. The light intensified, washing over them in waves of pure, vibrant amber. It seemed to penetrate their very being, warming them from within, chasing away any lingering chill. The air grew heavier, scented now with a faint sweetness that mingled with the ozone tang. Lyra felt a lightness settle in her chest, a sense of profound peace she hadn't known existed. Beside her, Sister Agnes moved with quiet grace, her gaze fixed ahead, a serene expression on her face. The chamber walls seemed to pulse with the light, the crystalline growths shimmering like frozen fire. They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe polished rock beneath their boots felt smooth, almost warm through the worn leather. The light intensified, washing over them in waves of pure, vibrant amber. It seemed to penetrate their very being, warming them from within, chasing away any lingering chill. The air grew heavier, scented now with a faint sweetness that mingled with the ozone tang. Lyra felt a lightness settle in her chest, a sense of profound peace she hadn't known existed. Beside her, Sister Agnes moved with quiet grace, her gaze fixed ahead, a serene expression on her face. The chamber walls seemed to pulse with the light, the crystalline growths shimmering like frozen fire. They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n\nAhead, the source of the light resolved into a complex structure, resonating with the familiar energy of The Celestial Core. As they approached, other concentrations of power became visible within the chamber. Nestled in a high crystalline arch was a collection of sixteen Sky-gems, pulsing softly. On a low, natural pedestal nearby lay a cluster of twelve Sky-gems, their facets catching the light in dazzling array. Further along the wall, embedded in a vein of shimmering quartz, they discovered another distinct group of twelve Sky-gems, mirroring the first in their quiet glow. In a small, shadowed alcove, a hidden hoard of nine Sky-gems cast a faint, internal luminescence. Finally, at the very center of the chamber, a significant mound, almost a small hillock of pure energy, contained thirty Sky-gems, their combined radiance overwhelming.\n\nAs the energies converged in the chamber's heart, the chaotic brilliance resolved into a rhythmic pattern. A distinct, steady pulse began to emanate from the central convergence point. It wasn't a flicker or a surge, but a clear, repeating sequence. As they watched, the light coalesced into a shimmering form that resolved into a core, completing a pattern before dissolving and reforming. This consistent, cyclical rhythm, they understood instantly, was the fundamental essence, the true, unwavering frequency that emerged when all the chamber's energies aligned. This, Lyra realized, was The Sky-Gem's True Pulse.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe rhythmic thrum of the True Pulse resonated not just in the air, but deep within their bones. The chamber, now bathed in a steady, unwavering luminescence, felt utterly transformed. The scattered concentrations of power seemed to hum in harmony with the central core, their individual glows merging into a unified, breathtaking display. Lyra felt a profound sense of clarity settle over her, the chaotic energies of before resolving into a perfect, simple truth. Kaelen stood silent, his gaze fixed on the pulsing heart of the room, a quiet awe etched upon his features. The air itself felt charged with ancient purpose, a palpable stillness descending as the chamber revealed its deepest secret.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe profound stillness held them captive. The air, thick with ancient power, hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the very core of their being. Lyra felt the chaotic whispers that had plagued her mind fade entirely, replaced by a simple, unwavering truth that shone brighter than any light. Kaelen remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent witness to the unveiled secret. The stone around them seemed to breathe with the same slow, steady rhythm, the light painting long, dancing shadows across the floor. A sense of timelessness settled over the space, leaving only the breathtaking revelation before them.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe breathtaking revelation held them, the silent song of the chamber now a tangible presence. Kaelen stirred first, his eyes tracing the patterns of light across the floor, patterns that seemed to shift and coalesce around specific concentrations of the ambient energy. Lyra followed his gaze, seeing the same phenomenon – pockets of intensified glow, each pulsing with a distinct frequency.\n\n\"Look,\" Kaelen murmured, his voice low. \"They gather... drawn by the chamber's heart.\"\n\nHe pointed to a cluster near the far wall, where the light seemed faintest, yet undeniably present. Near the entrance, a faint cluster held seven gems. Further in, a more vibrant gathering pulsed with thirteen. Closer to the chamber's heart, a steady light emanated from sixteen gems. In a shadowed alcove, twenty-seven gems pooled their energy. Near the central altar, a chaotic pulse came from twenty-eight. And closest to the core, the most powerful light radiated from thirty gems.\n\nThey stood amidst these distinct gatherings, the air thick with their varied frequencies. \"They arrange themselves,\" Lyra whispered, \"not by size, but by some unseen order.\" She walked slowly, observing the relative positions of the clusters, the interplay of their lights. The steady cluster seemed to occupy a unique position, a point of quiet balance amidst the others. It wasn't the most numerous, nor the least, but its presence felt like an anchor, a still point around which the other energies orbited.\n\nKaelen nodded, understanding dawning in his eyes. \"The fulcrum,\" he said, his voice filled with awe. \"This point of equilibrium. This is where the forces balance.\"\n\nLyra reached out a hand towards that specific concentration, feeling the steady thrum of its energy. It was here, in this specific cluster, that the chamber's power found its stability. This was the heart of the revelation, the point of perfect poise. This, they knew, was The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey stood before the steady cluster, the air around it humming with a quiet strength that felt like the very heart of the mountain. The varied lights of the other gems pulsed and shifted in the periphery, a silent dance of energies, yet their attention remained fixed on this point of perfect poise. A profound stillness settled over the chamber, broken only by the soft echo of their own breaths and the deep, resonant thrum beneath the stone floor. Lyra’s fingers hovered near the radiant core, feeling the deep resonance within her bones, a connection that transcended thought. Kaelen watched her, his gaze reflecting the subdued glow, a shared understanding passing between them without need for words. The weight of their journey, the trials faced, seemed to converge upon this single point of balance, a silent promise held within its unwavering light.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air around the core seemed to hold its breath, mirroring the stillness that had fallen over Lyra and Kaelen. The steady light cast long, dancing shadows across the ancient stone walls of the chamber. Dust motes caught the glow, swirling in slow currents that seemed as old as the mountain itself. Lyra felt the deep hum resonate within her, a silent song only her spirit could hear, a connection woven into the very fabric of the stone. Kaelen's eyes met hers across the space, a silent question and a shared resolve passing between them. The weight of the journey, the trials overcome, seemed to coalesce in this quiet space, a moment suspended outside the flow of time.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe profound stillness lingered, wrapping around them like a shroud woven from the mountain's breath. Lyra felt the ancient hum resonate deeper now, a silent song echoing in the core of her spirit, a connection forged in the heart of the stone itself. Kaelen's presence beside her was a quiet anchor in this timeless space, his eyes holding a depth of shared experience that needed no words. The dust motes, suspended in the soft light, drifted with infinite slowness, silent witnesses to ages gone by. This moment, held apart from the world's hurried pulse, felt like the turning of a page, a transition into something vast and unknown.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air grew heavy with the mountain's secrets, carrying the faint scent of earth and something else, something wild and untamed that whispered of the depths below. Lyra drew a slow breath, letting the ancient energy seep into her bones. Beside her, Kaelen remained a silent sentinel, his gaze fixed on the shifting patterns of light upon the stone. The silence between them was not empty, but filled with unspoken understanding, a quiet strength shared without need for words. The path forward remained veiled, but the pull of destiny, strong and undeniable, urged them onward through the timeless heart of the stone.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey took a step deeper into the mountain's embrace. The air grew cooler, carrying the scent of damp earth and forgotten things. Stone walls, rough and ancient, pressed close, their surfaces cool beneath their fingertips as they brushed past. Light from the world outside dwindled, leaving only the faint luminescence of Lyra's pendant to carve a path through the deepening gloom. Kaelen moved silently beside her, his shadow a constant companion to hers. The silence here was profound, broken only by the soft scrape of their boots on the stone floor and the distant, almost imperceptible drip of water somewhere unseen. A palpable sense of history clung to the very air, a weight of ages that settled upon their shoulders, urging them onward into the mountain's silent, waiting heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe passage twisted and turned, the rough-hewn walls pressing closer still. The air grew colder, carrying a damp chill that seeped into their bones, thick with the scent of subterranean water and ancient stone. Lyra's pendant cast a wavering pool of light, illuminating only a short distance ahead, leaving the rest of the tunnel swallowed by impenetrable shadow. The silence deepened, a heavy blanket broken only by the rhythmic drip of unseen water and the soft scuff of their boots on the uneven floor. Kaelen moved like a wraith beside her, his presence a silent anchor in the growing press of the mountain's embrace. The weight of the stone above felt immense, a tangible pressure urging them onward into the unknown depths.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe passage twisted and turned, the rough-hewn walls pressing closer still. The air grew colder, carrying a damp chill that seeped into their bones, thick with the scent of subterranean water and ancient stone. Lyra's pendant cast a wavering pool of light, illuminating only a short distance ahead, leaving the rest of the tunnel swallowed by impenetrable shadow. The silence deepened, a heavy blanket broken only by the rhythmic drip of unseen water and the soft scuff of their boots on the uneven floor. Kaelen moved like a wraith beside her, his presence a silent anchor in the growing press of the mountain's embrace. The weight of the stone above felt immense, a tangible pressure urging them onward into the unknown depths.\n\nThey rounded a bend and found a small fissure weeping with moisture. Nestled within a pocket of dark rock were **two** Sky-gems, their faint light struggling against the gloom. Kaelen carefully extracted them, placing them in a padded pouch. Further on, the tunnel opened slightly into a damp grotto where phosphorescent moss clung to the walls. Here, scattered across a ledge, lay **eleven** more Sky-gems, pulsing with a soft, steady rhythm. Lyra gathered these with practiced hands. The passage narrowed again, forcing them to move carefully through a section where the rock seemed to shimmer. Embedded in a crystalline vein were **twelve** Sky-gems, their facets catching the pendant's light and scattering it in tiny rainbows. Kaelen used a small, intricate tool to gently pry them free. Finally, the tunnel terminated in a small, circular chamber. In the center, resting on a natural stone pedestal, was a cluster of **twenty** Sky-gems, larger and more vibrant than the others they had found.\n\nThey brought these newly discovered gems together with the collection known as The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum. As the various quantities were placed side by side, a low thrumming filled the chamber. The combined light of the gems intensified dramatically, not just brighter, but focused. A device Kaelen carried, designed to measure the unique resonance of the Sky-gems, flared to life. Instead of a complex waveform or a fluctuating reading, it displayed a pure, fundamental symbol, representing the core essence now coalesced from the gathered power.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe chamber pulsed with a light that seemed to drink the shadows, the air thick with a resonant hum. Kaelen and Lyra watched, breathless, as the symbol on the device solidified, a perfect form born of pure energy. The combined glow of the gems washed over them, warming the damp chill of the cavern and filling the space with an almost palpable sense of ancient purpose. A quiet understanding passed between them, a shared recognition of the significance of this moment, the culmination of their long search. The silence that followed the intense resonance was profound, broken only by the soft, steady thrumming that now seemed to emanate from the very stone itself.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe intense light receded, leaving behind a soft, ambient glow that seemed woven into the very fabric of the cavern walls. The deep resonance faded to a soft, steady thrumming that vibrated gently beneath their feet, a constant pulse from the heart of the stone. Dust motes, disturbed by the energy surge, drifted lazily in the luminous air, catching the light like tiny, suspended stars. Kaelen let out a slow breath, the tension that had held him rigid finally dissolving. He looked at Lyra, her face illuminated by the ethereal light, her eyes wide with a mixture of exhaustion and profound wonder. A silent understanding passed between them, a shared recognition of the weight of the moment, the long path that had led them here, and the unknown journey that now stretched before them. The air, once heavy and damp, now felt light and charged, carrying the subtle scent of ancient magic and awakened power. They stood in the transformed space, letting the quiet significance of the event settle around them like a cloak.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey lingered in the soft, resonant quiet, the air thick with the scent of awakened stone and something akin to ozone, yet sweeter. The gentle thrum beneath their boots was a constant, comforting presence, a new heartbeat for this ancient place. Lyra exhaled softly, the sound barely disturbing the stillness. Her fingers brushed lightly against the cool, now faintly glowing rock face, tracing the intricate, pulsing patterns that seemed to have bloomed from within the stone itself. Kaelen watched her, the lines of tension around his eyes softening. A profound sense of completion mingled with the vast uncertainty of what came next. The path that had led them here was clear behind them, but the way forward was shrouded in the luminous haze, beckoning them deeper into the transformed heart of the cavern.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe luminous haze ahead pulsed gently, painting the cavern walls in shifting hues of sapphire and emerald. Lyra turned from the glowing stone, her gaze meeting Kaelen's across the shimmering air. A shared question hung unspoken between them – what lay beyond this radiant veil? The thrumming beneath their feet seemed to guide them, a silent invitation into the unknown depths. The air grew cooler, carrying faint whispers that might have been the wind, or perhaps the cavern itself breathing. They stepped forward together, the light ahead enveloping them like a soft promise.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe shimmering veil parted, not with a rush of air, but a gentle dissolution. They stepped through into a silence that felt deeper than any they had known. The vibrant light of the passage faded behind them, leaving them in a vast, echoing space where shadows danced like ancient spirits. Strange, luminous moss clung to towering rock formations, casting an ethereal glow that painted the cavern walls in shifting shades of violet and silver. The air here was still and cool, carrying a faint, sweet scent like rain on stone. A low, resonant hum vibrated through the ground, a pulse that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the earth beneath their feet. Lyra and Kaelen exchanged a look, their faces illuminated by the soft, otherworldly light, a shared sense of wonder and trepidation passing between them without a single word spoken. They were truly within the mountain's hidden core.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe low hum intensified as they moved deeper into the cavern. Luminous moss illuminated veins of shimmering ore embedded in the walls, but it was the scattered clusters of Sky-gems that drew their eyes. Near a pool of still water, they found a small cluster of **two** perfectly formed gems pulsing with soft light. Further along a narrow passage, a larger cache revealed **twelve** more, nestled in a crystalline hollow. Around a bend, they stumbled upon a significant deposit, a radiant hoard of **eighteen** gems that seemed to glow with an inner fire. Across the vast space, near a towering stalagmite, they located a cache holding **nineteen** gems, their light a vibrant blue. Not far from there, tucked beneath an overhang, another cache held **nineteen** more, mirroring the blue intensity of the first. Finally, in the heart of the chamber, a vast vein contained **twenty-four** gems, the largest collection yet, their combined brilliance almost overwhelming.\n\nLyra and Kaelen surveyed their findings, the varied sizes and intensities of the Sky-gems creating a complex tapestry of light across the cavern floor. They gathered the distinct groups, arranging them, seeking a pattern, a center point amidst the disparate quantities. Their gaze settled on this significant deposit. It seemed to anchor the entire collection, a point of perfect equilibrium around which the others naturally fell into place. This group, they realized, felt like the very heart of the mountain's energy, the true 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air in the cavern grew heavy with the combined luminescence of the gathered gems. Each stone pulsed with its own unique light, casting shifting patterns across the damp stone floor and highlighting the ancient veins in the walls. Lyra traced the outline of the central cluster with a fingertip, feeling a deep hum resonate through the rock beneath her hand. Kaelen watched her, his gaze moving from the radiant stones to the shadows that danced at the edges of their light. A quiet understanding passed between them, a shared sense of awe and the weight of their discovery. The cavern, once merely a passage, now felt like a sacred space, holding secrets whispered by the mountain itself.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe vibrant light of the gems painted the cavern walls in shifting hues of sapphire, emerald, and ruby. Dust motes danced in the radiant beams, suspended in the still, cool air. Lyra exhaled slowly, the sound soft in the profound quiet. Kaelen shifted his weight, his hand resting near the hilt of his blade, not in alarm, but in a quiet readiness that mirrored her own sense of anticipation. The air thrummed with the latent energy of the stones, a silent promise or a warning whispered by the deep earth. They lingered there, letting the weight of the discovery settle upon them, before turning their gaze towards the passages that beckoned from the cavern's edge, shrouded in deeper shadow.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe profound silence of the gem-lit cavern settled around them, a heavy blanket woven with the faint, resonant hum of the stones. The air, previously still, seemed to hold its breath. Lyra traced the cool, damp rock face with her fingers, feeling the ancient weight of the earth. Kaelen remained a silent sentinel beside her, his gaze sweeping the dark openings that beckoned from the cavern's perimeter. Each passage was a mouth of deeper shadow, swallowing the vibrant light of the gems before it could penetrate far within. They stood together, poised at the edge of the brilliance, contemplating the unknown paths that lay ahead, the quiet decision forming between them without need for spoken words.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nLyra and Kaelen stepped from the central brilliance into the first shadowed passage. The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved one perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the least significant collection. Its quiet glow, standing apart from the others, felt distinct, holding a unique potential. This isolated heart of light, the least among the many, they knew, would be their next focus. They designated it 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe Mist-Pearl pulsed softly among the gathered brilliance, a quiet heart amidst the dazzling array. Its light, distinct and subtle, drew their gaze away from the larger, more vibrant clusters. The cavern air hung cool and still, carrying the faint scent of damp stone and ancient dust. Shadows danced and stretched across the rough walls, sculpted by the combined glow of their discoveries. Kaelen and Lyra exchanged a look, a silent understanding passing between them. The path forward felt clear, guided by the gentle luminescence of the small, chosen gem.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe Mist-Pearl rested in Kaelen's palm, its soft radiance a gentle counterpoint to the harsher gleam of the other treasures they had uncovered. Lyra reached out a hand, her fingers hovering near the cool surface of the gem. A shared breath hung in the air between them. The cavern walls seemed to lean closer now, the shadows deepening around the edges of their light. A faint, distant echo drifted through the stone, suggesting unseen depths beyond. They turned together, their steps falling soft upon the damp earth, the pearl's glow leading the way into the waiting dark.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe passage ahead wound into deeper stone, the air growing cool and damp. The pearl held aloft by Kaelen cast its gentle luminescence, pushing back the oppressive dark that clung to the tunnel walls. Each step echoed softly on the earth, a quiet rhythm shared between them as they moved away from the chamber's secrets. The scent of ancient rock and unseen, flowing water filled the air. Lyra walked close, her gaze occasionally lifting to the pearl, then to Kaelen's profile illuminated by its glow. The path twisted and turned, a labyrinthine passage leading them into the unknown, the silence pressing in, broken only by their passage and the faint, persistent drip of water somewhere in the stone's heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe stone passage swallowed them whole. The pearl's gentle radiance seemed to shrink, its light struggling against the immense weight of the earth above. The air grew colder still, carrying the faint, clean scent of deep rock and unseen springs. Lyra pulled her cloak tighter, the rough fabric a small comfort against the pervasive dampness. Kaelen moved with quiet purpose, his form a steady silhouette against the shifting light. The only sounds were their careful steps and the distant, rhythmic *drip... drip...* of water, a lonely sound in the profound silence. Lyra watched the way ahead, a sense of anticipation and unease mingling within her. The path twisted onward, a blind descent into the heart of the mountain.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air grew thick with the scent of damp earth and ancient stone. Lyra's breath plumed faintly in the chill. The pearl, clutched in Kaelen's hand, cast a limited pool of light, illuminating only a few paces ahead before the darkness swallowed everything. The passage walls, rough-hewn and slick with moisture, pressed close on either side. Each step echoed, a small intrusion on the profound silence that seemed to absorb all other sound. Lyra trailed her fingers along the cold rock, feeling the uneven surface, the faint tremor of the mountain's heart beating deep below. Kaelen moved with unhurried grace, his gaze steady, seemingly unbothered by the oppressive weight overhead. They walked deeper, the descent gradual but relentless, leaving the surface world far behind.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe descent continued, a slow, steady surrender to the mountain's embrace. The air grew heavier, thick with the ancient quiet that permeated the stone. Lyra's hand remained against the wall, seeking comfort in the rough texture, feeling the deep, slow pulse of the earth itself. The pearl's glow offered scant reassurance, pushing back the absolute blackness only slightly. Kaelen moved like a part of the shadow, his presence a silent anchor in the oppressive dark. Each breath felt cold in their lungs, each sound they made seemed swallowed instantly by the profound stillness. They walked on, leaving the world of sun and sky far behind, sinking deeper into the mountain's heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThey moved through the echoing silence, the pearl's light a small, fragile bubble against the vast dark. The air grew colder, carrying the scent of damp earth and something else, something mineral and sharp. Kaelen stopped, his hand raised. Against the rough stone wall, embedded in a shallow fissure, pulsed a cluster of faint blue light. Lyra knelt, her fingers tracing the cool surface of the first Sky-gems they had found in this depth. There were **three** such gems here, nestled together like tiny eggs.\n\nFurther along the passage, where a narrow vein of quartz cut through the rock, another discovery awaited. Here, the Sky-gems were smaller, like scattered seeds, but more numerous. Lyra counted them carefully in the dim light; there were **nine** in this scattered collection.\n\nThe tunnel opened into a small cavern, the air suddenly feeling vast and empty. And there, dominating the space from a pedestal of natural stone, lay a magnificent cluster of light. It wasn't just a few gems; it was a cascade of light, a breathtaking hoard. These Sky-gems were larger, more vibrant than any they had seen before, their combined glow pushing back the shadows with authority. Lyra felt a gasp catch in her throat as she took in the sheer quantity; there were **twenty-five** of these luminous treasures piled high.\n\nKaelen stepped closer, his eyes scanning the hoard, then glancing back towards the passage where they had found the smaller groups, and even further back in his mind, to the faint memory of The Mist-Pearl. The contrast was stark. The cluster on the pedestal pulsed with a power that dwarfed the others. It was clear, without question, that this last discovery was the most significant, the heart of the mountain's hoard. This was not just another collection of Sky-gems; this was the pinnacle, the ultimate expression of their quest. They knew, with a certainty that settled deep in their bones, that they had found what would henceforth be known as The Sovereign Sky-Gem.", "question": "---\n\n**Question:** The story describes a sequence of operations that modify a quantifiable measure related to 'Sky-gems'. Following this entire sequence, what is the final, precise numerical value of this measure at the conclusion of all activities? Provide only the single integer.", "full_text_for_eval": "Mist clung to the edges of the world, a damp, swirling veil that obscured the drop below. Lyra Meadowlight knelt by the lip of the floating island, the damp stone cool beneath her palms. Below, nothing but the endless, churning grey. Above, the faint, ethereal glow of Sky-gems pulsed within the rocky crust, their light muted by the pervasive fog. They were the lifeblood of these scattered lands, their slow, steady thrum a constant presence.\n\nA soft footstep sounded behind her. Lyra turned to see Sister Agnes approaching, her kindly face etched with a familiar, unsettling worry. The village healer's eyes, usually warm, held a distant, troubled look.\n\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\n\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister. More hesitant.\"\n\nSister Agnes knelt beside her, her gaze following Lyra's. A sigh escaped her lips, thin and weary. \"They are. The light fades across all the islands. A creeping chill takes hold.\" She paused, her fingers tracing a pattern on the damp stone. \"We cannot simply wait. The old ways speak of places where the light burns brighter, where the gems are born in abundance.\"\n\nShe looked at Lyra, her eyes holding a plea, a silent question. \"A journey must be made. A perilous path across the mist-shrouded void, seeking the heart of the light before it is extinguished entirely.\" The air seemed to grow colder, the faint pulse of the Sky-gems nearby seeming weaker than before. The need was clear, the destination unknown, and the path fraught with unseen dangers lurking in the grey depths.\n\nThe mist swirled thicker as Lyra and Sister Agnes stepped onto the crumbling stone circle. The air here felt different, heavy with the scent of damp rock and something else, something ancient and dormant. This chamber was a 'place of abundance' the old texts spoke of, though it seemed long forgotten. They moved with quiet purpose, their eyes scanning the shadowed alcoves and fissures in the rock.\n\nIn a small, almost hidden niche, Lyra spotted a cluster of gems, their light a soft, steady pulse. She counted them carefully: there were **five** Sky-gems nestled together. Further into the chamber, Sister Agnes pointed towards a larger vein running across the ceiling; embedded within it were precisely **ten** gleaming stones. Deeper still, in a collapsed section, they unearthed another collection, numbering **eleven** in total.\n\nTheir search led them to a narrow passage where the air grew colder. Here, clinging to the damp walls, they found **seventeen** gems, their glow faint but persistent. A larger, central cavern yielded the most impressive find yet, a shimmering deposit containing **twenty-one** Sky-gems. Finally, near the chamber's exit, almost overlooked, was a scattering of **twenty-three** stones, their light diffused across the floor.\n\nThey paused, looking at the various sources they had discovered. Each held a different intensity, a different presence. They needed to understand the core, the fundamental spark that fueled the greater light. Their gaze settled upon the smallest, most contained cluster. It was here, in this humble gathering, that they felt the purest, most concentrated essence of the light's potential. This, they knew, was not just a collection of gems; it was the fundamental flicker, the origin point they sought. They designated this specific discovery as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey knelt before the smallest gathering of light, the air around it thrumming with a silent energy. The gems pulsed gently, casting intricate shadows that danced across the rough stone walls. Lyra felt a profound sense of connection, as if the very essence of the cavern breathed through these stones. Sister Agnes closed her eyes for a moment, absorbing the quiet power, a serene expression settling upon her features. This was more than just a find; it was a revelation, a glimpse into the fundamental nature of the light itself. The echoing silence of the deep earth seemed to hold its breath, witnessing this moment of understanding.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe soft, pulsing light from the cluster of gems cast long, dancing shadows across the rough cavern walls. The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and ancient stone, seemed to hold its breath, reverent and still. Lyra felt the profound quiet settle deep within her, a sense of peace washing over the earlier tension of their descent. Sister Agnes remained kneeling, her head bowed slightly, a faint smile gracing her lips as if communing with the very essence of the light. The gems hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the core of their beings, a fundamental truth revealed in the deep dark. They lingered in the glow, letting the quiet energy seep into their weary forms, a silent acknowledgment passing between them in the sacred space.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe gentle pulse of the gems continued its silent song. Lyra watched the light dance, mesmerized by the shifting patterns on the ancient stone. The air felt cooler now, carrying the faint, clean scent of deep rock. Sister Agnes slowly rose from her knees, her movements quiet and deliberate. A soft sigh escaped her lips, a sound of contentment rather than weariness. Her eyes, reflecting the gem light, held a deep, peaceful glow. They stood together in the luminous heart of the cavern, letting the profound stillness wrap around them like a cloak. The world beyond this radiant chamber felt distant, irrelevant, lost in the quiet hum of the earth's hidden energy.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe gem-light pulsed, painting the cavern walls with shifting hues of emerald and sapphire. Dust motes danced in the radiant beams, tiny specks caught in the silent, ancient energy. Lyra felt the stillness settle deep within her bones, a quiet counterpoint to the world she knew above. Sister Agnes remained beside her, a calm presence radiating peace. The air, cool and pure, carried the faint scent of damp stone and something older, something elemental. A shared breath hung between them, unspoken understanding passing in the luminous glow. The path ahead, though unseen from this radiant heart, beckoned softly, a whispered call from the shadowed tunnels beyond the light's reach.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe vibrant pulse of the gem subsided, leaving a softer, persistent luminescence that painted the cavern walls in hues of deep green and twilight blue. The profound stillness remained, a sacred hush that pressed gently against the ears. Lyra breathed deeply, the scent of damp stone and forgotten ages filling her lungs. A sense of peace, fragile yet profound, settled within her. Beside her, Sister Agnes stood like a silent sentinel, her presence a comforting anchor. Their shared moment in the light faded as they turned, their gazes drawn to the mouth of a shadowed passage where the light did not reach. The air shifted, becoming cooler, carrying the faint, earthy smell of the deep tunnels that lay ahead, waiting.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe gentle light of the chamber receded behind them, leaving the passage ahead in absolute shadow. It was not merely dark, but a palpable absence of light, a hungry void that seemed to absorb even the faint luminescence clinging to their clothes. The air here was heavy, damp, and colder than the cavern they had just left, carrying the unmistakable scent of deep, undisturbed earth and mineral deposits. Lyra felt a prickle of apprehension crawl across her skin, a primal unease at the unknown that lay hidden within the unyielding blackness. Beside her, Sister Agnes was a silent, steady presence, her breathing calm, her gaze fixed on the entrance as if peering into the very heart of the mountain. The silence between them was complete, a shared acknowledgment of the daunting path that awaited, shrouded in mystery and the promise of what lay beneath the world they knew.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe oppressive darkness of the passage clung to them, thick and absolute. Lyra moved cautiously, her hand brushing against the rough-hewn stone of the wall. Sister Agnes followed, her presence a quiet anchor in the void. The air grew colder, carrying the faint, metallic tang of deep earth. As they ventured deeper, a faint luminescence began to pierce the gloom – the soft, internal light of Sky-gems embedded in the rock.\n\nNear the entrance of a narrow side tunnel, Lyra spotted a small cluster, their light barely visible through a thin layer of dust. Carefully, she extracted **six** Sky-gems. Further along the main passage, where the ceiling dipped low, Sister Agnes pointed out another cache hidden in a crystalline growth; they gathered **nine** from this find. The passage widened into a small grotto, and scattered across the floor, almost like fallen stars, lay **fifteen** more.\n\nPushing deeper into the mountain's heart, they discovered a rich vein running through the rock face. From this, they meticulously collected **eighteen** Sky-gems. In a parallel shaft, accessed through a low crawlspace, another significant deposit was found, yielding a further **eighteen**. A small, intricate pocket within the rock revealed **nineteen** gems, nestled together like luminous eggs. Finally, entering a vast, echoing cavern, they beheld a massive geode pulsing with soft light, from which they harvested **twenty-six** magnificent Sky-gems.\n\nWith reverent care, they brought these newly gathered treasures together. They also added the precious collection known only as The Sky-gem's Spark, which they had guarded since their journey began. All were placed upon a large, flat stone at the cavern's center. As the distinct groups of gems settled together, their individual lights merged, swirling into a unified radiance that pulsed with immense, contained power. This radiant, combined mass became known, from that moment forth, as The Celestial Core.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe vast cavern breathed with the new light. The Celestial Core pulsed upon the stone, a contained star banishing the ancient darkness that had held sway. Lyra watched its steady beat, a deep weariness settling alongside a quiet, profound reverence. Sister Agnes knelt nearby, her face bathed in the soft radiance, her lips moving in silent contemplation. The air felt different now, charged with a potential that spoke not of endings, but of a path yet to unfold. The silence of the deep earth held their breath, awaiting the next step of their quest.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air in the cavern hummed with a vibrant, new energy. The harsh edges of the stone softened in the pervasive glow of the Celestial Core, revealing veins of crystal that had long been hidden in shadow. A deep, resonant silence settled over the space, broken only by the gentle pulse of the light itself. Lyra closed her eyes for a moment, letting the warmth seep into her weary bones, the profound quiet a balm after the trials they had faced. Sister Agnes stood nearby, her face serene, a silent prayer upon her lips. The oppressive weight of the deep earth seemed to recede, replaced by a feeling of potent possibility. They were poised at the edge of something vast, the path forward illuminated by the heart of the mountain itself.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe luminous heart of the mountain pulsed with a gentle rhythm, casting its ethereal glow across the vast chamber. Every facet of crystal, every curve of ancient rock, was bathed in a light that felt both warm and invigorating. The oppressive chill of the deep earth was replaced by a comforting warmth, and the air itself seemed to shimmer with latent energy. Lyra met Sister Agnes's eyes across the glowing expanse, a shared look acknowledging the profound shift in the atmosphere. The silence was no longer heavy but expectant, filled with the quiet hum of the core and the soft echo of their own breathing. This place, moments ago a daunting challenge, now felt like a sacred space, a promise whispered in light.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe luminous heart deepened its pulse, the golden light warming to a profound amber that seeped into every crevice of the crystalline walls. Shadows lengthened and swayed like silent dancers across the floor of polished rock. A subtle current, warm and inviting, seemed to flow from the core, a gentle urging against their skin. Lyra felt it, a soft hum resonating deep within her bones. Across the radiant expanse, Sister Agnes offered a small, rare smile, her eyes reflecting the chamber's brilliance. The silence that had been expectant now felt like a shared breath, held in reverence. They stepped forward together, drawn by the irresistible call of the light.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey moved deeper into the heart of the light. The air grew warmer, thick with the scent of ozone and something ancient, like sun-baked stone mixed with fresh rain. The amber glow pulsed steadily now, painting long, dancing shadows that stretched and contracted with each beat. Crystalline formations jutted from the walls, catching the light and shattering it into shimmering fragments that danced across the floor. Lyra felt the hum deepen, a resonance that seemed to align her very being with the chamber's core. Beside her, Sister Agnes's presence was a quiet anchor, their shared wonder a silent language. The silence was profound, broken only by the gentle thrum of the chamber's heart and the soft sound of their steps on the polished rock. They walked towards the source, drawn by an unseen force, their path illuminated by the radiant core.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe polished rock beneath their boots felt smooth, almost warm through the worn leather. The light intensified, washing over them in waves of pure, vibrant amber. It seemed to penetrate their very being, warming them from within, chasing away any lingering chill. The air grew heavier, scented now with a faint sweetness that mingled with the ozone tang. Lyra felt a lightness settle in her chest, a sense of profound peace she hadn't known existed. Beside her, Sister Agnes moved with quiet grace, her gaze fixed ahead, a serene expression on her face. The chamber walls seemed to pulse with the light, the crystalline growths shimmering like frozen fire. They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe polished rock beneath their boots felt smooth, almost warm through the worn leather.

The chamber walls seemed to pulse with the light, the crystalline growths shimmering like frozen fire. They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n\nAhead, the source of the light resolved into a complex structure, resonating with the familiar energy of The Celestial Core. As they approached, other concentrations of power became visible within the chamber. Nestled in a high crystalline arch was a collection of sixteen Sky-gems, pulsing softly. On a low, natural pedestal nearby lay a cluster of twelve Sky-gems, their facets catching the light in dazzling array. Further along the wall, embedded in a vein of shimmering quartz, they discovered another distinct group of twelve Sky-gems, mirroring the first in their quiet glow. In a small, shadowed alcove, a hidden hoard of nine Sky-gems cast a faint, internal luminescence. Finally, at the very center of the chamber, a significant mound, almost a small hillock of pure energy, contained thirty Sky-gems, their combined radiance overwhelming.\n\nAs the energies converged in the chamber's heart, the chaotic brilliance resolved into a rhythmic pattern. A distinct, steady pulse began to emanate from the central convergence point. It wasn't a flicker or a surge, but a clear, repeating sequence. As they watched, the light coalesced into a shimmering form that resolved into a core, completing a pattern before dissolving and reforming. This consistent, cyclical rhythm, they understood instantly, was the fundamental essence, the true, unwavering frequency that emerged when all the chamber's energies aligned. This, Lyra realized, was The Sky-Gem's True Pulse.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe rhythmic thrum of the True Pulse resonated not just in the air, but deep within their bones. The chamber, now bathed in a steady, unwavering luminescence, felt utterly transformed. The scattered concentrations of power seemed to hum in harmony with the central core, their individual glows merging into a unified, breathtaking display. Lyra felt a profound sense of clarity settle over her, the chaotic energies of before resolving into a perfect, simple truth. Kaelen stood silent, his gaze fixed on the pulsing heart of the room, a quiet awe etched upon his features. The air itself felt charged with ancient purpose, a palpable stillness descending as the chamber revealed its deepest secret.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe profound stillness held them captive. The air, thick with ancient power, hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the very core of their being. Lyra felt the chaotic whispers that had plagued her mind fade entirely, replaced by a simple, unwavering truth that shone brighter than any light. Kaelen remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent witness to the unveiled secret. The stone around them seemed to breathe with the same slow, steady rhythm, the light painting long, dancing shadows across the floor. A sense of timelessness settled over the space, leaving only the breathtaking revelation before them.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe breathtaking revelation held them, the silent song of the chamber now a tangible presence. Kaelen stirred first, his eyes tracing the patterns of light across the floor, patterns that seemed to shift and coalesce around specific concentrations of the ambient energy. Lyra followed his gaze, seeing the same phenomenon – pockets of intensified glow, each pulsing with a distinct frequency.\n\n\"Look,\" Kaelen murmured, his voice low. \"They gather... drawn by the chamber's heart.\"\n\nHe pointed to a cluster near the far wall, where the light seemed faintest, yet undeniably present. Near the entrance, a faint cluster held seven gems. Further in, a more vibrant gathering pulsed with thirteen. Closer to the chamber's heart, a steady light emanated from sixteen gems. In a shadowed alcove, twenty-seven gems pooled their energy. Near the central altar, a chaotic pulse came from twenty-eight. And closest to the core, the most powerful light radiated from thirty gems.\n\nThey stood amidst these distinct gatherings, the air thick with their varied frequencies. \"They arrange themselves,\" Lyra whispered, \"not by size, but by some unseen order.\" She walked slowly, observing the relative positions of the clusters, the interplay of their lights. The steady cluster seemed to occupy a unique position, a point of quiet balance amidst the others. It wasn't the most numerous, nor the least, but its presence felt like an anchor, a still point around which the other energies orbited.\n\nKaelen nodded, understanding dawning in his eyes. \"The fulcrum,\" he said, his voice filled with awe. \"This point of equilibrium. This is where the forces balance.\"\n\nLyra reached out a hand towards that specific concentration, feeling the steady thrum of its energy. It was here, in this specific cluster, that the chamber's power found its stability. This was the heart of the revelation, the point of perfect poise. This, they knew, was The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey stood before the steady cluster, the air around it humming with a quiet strength that felt like the very heart of the mountain. The varied lights of the other gems pulsed and shifted in the periphery, a silent dance of energies, yet their attention remained fixed on this point of perfect poise. A profound stillness settled over the chamber, broken only by the soft echo of their own breaths and the deep, resonant thrum beneath the stone floor. Lyra’s fingers hovered near the radiant core, feeling the deep resonance within her bones, a connection that transcended thought. Kaelen watched her, his gaze reflecting the subdued glow, a shared understanding passing between them without need for words. The weight of their journey, the trials faced, seemed to converge upon this single point of balance, a silent promise held within its unwavering light.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air around the core seemed to hold its breath, mirroring the stillness that had fallen over Lyra and Kaelen. The steady light cast long, dancing shadows across the ancient stone walls of the chamber. Dust motes caught the glow, swirling in slow currents that seemed as old as the mountain itself. Lyra felt the deep hum resonate within her, a silent song only her spirit could hear, a connection woven into the very fabric of the stone. Kaelen's eyes met hers across the space, a silent question and a shared resolve passing between them. The weight of the journey, the trials overcome, seemed to coalesce in this quiet space, a moment suspended outside the flow of time.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe profound stillness lingered, wrapping around them like a shroud woven from the mountain's breath. Lyra felt the ancient hum resonate deeper now, a silent song echoing in the core of her spirit, a connection forged in the heart of the stone itself. Kaelen's presence beside her was a quiet anchor in this timeless space, his eyes holding a depth of shared experience that needed no words. The dust motes, suspended in the soft light, drifted with infinite slowness, silent witnesses to ages gone by. This moment, held apart from the world's hurried pulse, felt like the turning of a page, a transition into something vast and unknown.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air grew heavy with the mountain's secrets, carrying the faint scent of earth and something else, something wild and untamed that whispered of the depths below. Lyra drew a slow breath, letting the ancient energy seep into her bones. Beside her, Kaelen remained a silent sentinel, his gaze fixed on the shifting patterns of light upon the stone. The silence between them was not empty, but filled with unspoken understanding, a quiet strength shared without need for words. The path forward remained veiled, but the pull of destiny, strong and undeniable, urged them onward through the timeless heart of the stone.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey took a step deeper into the mountain's embrace. The air grew cooler, carrying the scent of damp earth and forgotten things. Stone walls, rough and ancient, pressed close, their surfaces cool beneath their fingertips as they brushed past. Light from the world outside dwindled, leaving only the faint luminescence of Lyra's pendant to carve a path through the deepening gloom. Kaelen moved silently beside her, his shadow a constant companion to hers. The silence here was profound, broken only by the soft scrape of their boots on the stone floor and the distant, almost imperceptible drip of water somewhere unseen. A palpable sense of history clung to the very air, a weight of ages that settled upon their shoulders, urging them onward into the mountain's silent, waiting heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe passage twisted and turned, the rough-hewn walls pressing closer still. The air grew colder, carrying a damp chill that seeped into their bones, thick with the scent of subterranean water and ancient stone. Lyra's pendant cast a wavering pool of light, illuminating only a short distance ahead, leaving the rest of the tunnel swallowed by impenetrable shadow. The silence deepened, a heavy blanket broken only by the rhythmic drip of unseen water and the soft scuff of their boots on the uneven floor. Kaelen moved like a wraith beside her, his presence a silent anchor in the growing press of the mountain's embrace. The weight of the stone above felt immense, a tangible pressure urging them onward into the unknown depths.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe passage twisted and turned, the rough-hewn walls pressing closer still. The air grew colder, carrying a damp chill that seeped into their bones, thick with the scent of subterranean water and ancient stone. Lyra's pendant cast a wavering pool of light, illuminating only a short distance ahead, leaving the rest of the tunnel swallowed by impenetrable shadow. The silence deepened, a heavy blanket broken only by the rhythmic drip of unseen water and the soft scuff of their boots on the uneven floor. Kaelen moved like a wraith beside her, his presence a silent anchor in the growing press of the mountain's embrace. The weight of the stone above felt immense, a tangible pressure urging them onward into the unknown depths.\n\nThey rounded a bend and found a small fissure weeping with moisture. Nestled within a pocket of dark rock were **two** Sky-gems, their faint light struggling against the gloom. Kaelen carefully extracted them, placing them in a padded pouch. Further on, the tunnel opened slightly into a damp grotto where phosphorescent moss clung to the walls. Here, scattered across a ledge, lay **eleven** more Sky-gems, pulsing with a soft, steady rhythm. Lyra gathered these with practiced hands. The passage narrowed again, forcing them to move carefully through a section where the rock seemed to shimmer. Embedded in a crystalline vein were **twelve** Sky-gems, their facets catching the pendant's light and scattering it in tiny rainbows. Kaelen used a small, intricate tool to gently pry them free. Finally, the tunnel terminated in a small, circular chamber. In the center, resting on a natural stone pedestal, was a cluster of **twenty** Sky-gems, larger and more vibrant than the others they had found.\n\nThey brought these newly discovered gems together with the collection known as The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum. As the various quantities were placed side by side, a low thrumming filled the chamber. The combined light of the gems intensified dramatically, not just brighter, but focused. A device Kaelen carried, designed to measure the unique resonance of the Sky-gems, flared to life. Instead of a complex waveform or a fluctuating reading, it displayed a pure, fundamental symbol, representing the core essence now coalesced from the gathered power.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe chamber pulsed with a light that seemed to drink the shadows, the air thick with a resonant hum. Kaelen and Lyra watched, breathless, as the symbol on the device solidified, a perfect form born of pure energy. The combined glow of the gems washed over them, warming the damp chill of the cavern and filling the space with an almost palpable sense of ancient purpose. A quiet understanding passed between them, a shared recognition of the significance of this moment, the culmination of their long search. The silence that followed the intense resonance was profound, broken only by the soft, steady thrumming that now seemed to emanate from the very stone itself.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe intense light receded, leaving behind a soft, ambient glow that seemed woven into the very fabric of the cavern walls. The deep resonance faded to a soft, steady thrumming that vibrated gently beneath their feet, a constant pulse from the heart of the stone. Dust motes, disturbed by the energy surge, drifted lazily in the luminous air, catching the light like tiny, suspended stars. Kaelen let out a slow breath, the tension that had held him rigid finally dissolving. He looked at Lyra, her face illuminated by the ethereal light, her eyes wide with a mixture of exhaustion and profound wonder. A silent understanding passed between them, a shared recognition of the weight of the moment, the long path that had led them here, and the unknown journey that now stretched before them. The air, once heavy and damp, now felt light and charged, carrying the subtle scent of ancient magic and awakened power. They stood in the transformed space, letting the quiet significance of the event settle around them like a cloak.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThey lingered in the soft, resonant quiet, the air thick with the scent of awakened stone and something akin to ozone, yet sweeter. The gentle thrum beneath their boots was a constant, comforting presence, a new heartbeat for this ancient place. Lyra exhaled softly, the sound barely disturbing the stillness. Her fingers brushed lightly against the cool, now faintly glowing rock face, tracing the intricate, pulsing patterns that seemed to have bloomed from within the stone itself. Kaelen watched her, the lines of tension around his eyes softening. A profound sense of completion mingled with the vast uncertainty of what came next. The path that had led them here was clear behind them, but the way forward was shrouded in the luminous haze, beckoning them deeper into the transformed heart of the cavern.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe luminous haze ahead pulsed gently, painting the cavern walls in shifting hues of sapphire and emerald. Lyra turned from the glowing stone, her gaze meeting Kaelen's across the shimmering air. A shared question hung unspoken between them – what lay beyond this radiant veil? The thrumming beneath their feet seemed to guide them, a silent invitation into the unknown depths. The air grew cooler, carrying faint whispers that might have been the wind, or perhaps the cavern itself breathing. They stepped forward together, the light ahead enveloping them like a soft promise.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe shimmering veil parted, not with a rush of air, but a gentle dissolution. They stepped through into a silence that felt deeper than any they had known. The vibrant light of the passage faded behind them, leaving them in a vast, echoing space where shadows danced like ancient spirits. Strange, luminous moss clung to towering rock formations, casting an ethereal glow that painted the cavern walls in shifting shades of violet and silver. The air here was still and cool, carrying a faint, sweet scent like rain on stone. A low, resonant hum vibrated through the ground, a pulse that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the earth beneath their feet. Lyra and Kaelen exchanged a look, their faces illuminated by the soft, otherworldly light, a shared sense of wonder and trepidation passing between them without a single word spoken. They were truly within the mountain's hidden core.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThe low hum intensified as they moved deeper into the cavern. Luminous moss illuminated veins of shimmering ore embedded in the walls, but it was the scattered clusters of Sky-gems that drew their eyes. Near a pool of still water, they found a small cluster of **two** perfectly formed gems pulsing with soft light. Further along a narrow passage, a larger cache revealed **twelve** more, nestled in a crystalline hollow. Around a bend, they stumbled upon a significant deposit, a radiant hoard of **eighteen** gems that seemed to glow with an inner fire. Across the vast space, near a towering stalagmite, they located a cache holding **nineteen** gems, their light a vibrant blue. Not far from there, tucked beneath an overhang, another cache held **nineteen** more, mirroring the blue intensity of the first. Finally, in the heart of the chamber, a vast vein contained **twenty-four** gems, the largest collection yet, their combined brilliance almost overwhelming.\n\nLyra and Kaelen surveyed their findings, the varied sizes and intensities of the Sky-gems creating a complex tapestry of light across the cavern floor. They gathered the distinct groups, arranging them, seeking a pattern, a center point amidst the disparate quantities. Their gaze settled on this significant deposit. It seemed to anchor the entire collection, a point of perfect equilibrium around which the others naturally fell into place. This group, they realized, felt like the very heart of the mountain's energy, the true 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air in the cavern grew heavy with the combined luminescence of the gathered gems. Each stone pulsed with its own unique light, casting shifting patterns across the damp stone floor and highlighting the ancient veins in the walls. Lyra traced the outline of the central cluster with a fingertip, feeling a deep hum resonate through the rock beneath her hand. Kaelen watched her, his gaze moving from the radiant stones to the shadows that danced at the edges of their light. A quiet understanding passed between them, a shared sense of awe and the weight of their discovery. The cavern, once merely a passage, now felt like a sacred space, holding secrets whispered by the mountain itself.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe vibrant light of the gems painted the cavern walls in shifting hues of sapphire, emerald, and ruby. Dust motes danced in the radiant beams, suspended in the still, cool air. Lyra exhaled slowly, the sound soft in the profound quiet. Kaelen shifted his weight, his hand resting near the hilt of his blade, not in alarm, but in a quiet readiness that mirrored her own sense of anticipation. The air thrummed with the latent energy of the stones, a silent promise or a warning whispered by the deep earth. They lingered there, letting the weight of the discovery settle upon them, before turning their gaze towards the passages that beckoned from the cavern's edge, shrouded in deeper shadow.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe profound silence of the gem-lit cavern settled around them, a heavy blanket woven with the faint, resonant hum of the stones. The air, previously still, seemed to hold its breath. Lyra traced the cool, damp rock face with her fingers, feeling the ancient weight of the earth. Kaelen remained a silent sentinel beside her, his gaze sweeping the dark openings that beckoned from the cavern's perimeter. Each passage was a mouth of deeper shadow, swallowing the vibrant light of the gems before it could penetrate far within. They stood together, poised at the edge of the brilliance, contemplating the unknown paths that lay ahead, the quiet decision forming between them without need for spoken words.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nLyra and Kaelen stepped from the central brilliance into the first shadowed passage. The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved one perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the least significant collection. Its quiet glow, standing apart from the others, felt distinct, holding a unique potential. This isolated heart of light, the least among the many, they knew, would be their next focus. They designated it 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe Mist-Pearl pulsed softly among the gathered brilliance, a quiet heart amidst the dazzling array. Its light, distinct and subtle, drew their gaze away from the larger, more vibrant clusters. The cavern air hung cool and still, carrying the faint scent of damp stone and ancient dust. Shadows danced and stretched across the rough walls, sculpted by the combined glow of their discoveries. Kaelen and Lyra exchanged a look, a silent understanding passing between them. The path forward felt clear, guided by the gentle luminescence of the small, chosen gem.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe Mist-Pearl rested in Kaelen's palm, its soft radiance a gentle counterpoint to the harsher gleam of the other treasures they had uncovered. Lyra reached out a hand, her fingers hovering near the cool surface of the gem. A shared breath hung in the air between them. The cavern walls seemed to lean closer now, the shadows deepening around the edges of their light. A faint, distant echo drifted through the stone, suggesting unseen depths beyond. They turned together, their steps falling soft upon the damp earth, the pearl's glow leading the way into the waiting dark.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe passage ahead wound into deeper stone, the air growing cool and damp. The pearl held aloft by Kaelen cast its gentle luminescence, pushing back the oppressive dark that clung to the tunnel walls. Each step echoed softly on the earth, a quiet rhythm shared between them as they moved away from the chamber's secrets. The scent of ancient rock and unseen, flowing water filled the air. Lyra walked close, her gaze occasionally lifting to the pearl, then to Kaelen's profile illuminated by its glow. The path twisted and turned, a labyrinthine passage leading them into the unknown, the silence pressing in, broken only by their passage and the faint, persistent drip of water somewhere in the stone's heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe stone passage swallowed them whole. The pearl's gentle radiance seemed to shrink, its light struggling against the immense weight of the earth above. The air grew colder still, carrying the faint, clean scent of deep rock and unseen springs. Lyra pulled her cloak tighter, the rough fabric a small comfort against the pervasive dampness. Kaelen moved with quiet purpose, his form a steady silhouette against the shifting light. The only sounds were their careful steps and the distant, rhythmic *drip... drip...* of water, a lonely sound in the profound silence. Lyra watched the way ahead, a sense of anticipation and unease mingling within her. The path twisted onward, a blind descent into the heart of the mountain.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe air grew thick with the scent of damp earth and ancient stone. Lyra's breath plumed faintly in the chill. The pearl, clutched in Kaelen's hand, cast a limited pool of light, illuminating only a few paces ahead before the darkness swallowed everything. The passage walls, rough-hewn and slick with moisture, pressed close on either side. Each step echoed, a small intrusion on the profound silence that seemed to absorb all other sound. Lyra trailed her fingers along the cold rock, feeling the uneven surface, the faint tremor of the mountain's heart beating deep below. Kaelen moved with unhurried grace, his gaze steady, seemingly unbothered by the oppressive weight overhead. They walked deeper, the descent gradual but relentless, leaving the surface world far behind.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\n\n[Padding Segment]\nThe descent continued, a slow, steady surrender to the mountain's embrace. The air grew heavier, thick with the ancient quiet that permeated the stone. Lyra's hand remained against the wall, seeking comfort in the rough texture, feeling the deep, slow pulse of the earth itself. The pearl's glow offered scant reassurance, pushing back the absolute blackness only slightly. Kaelen moved like a part of the shadow, his presence a silent anchor in the oppressive dark. Each breath felt cold in their lungs, each sound they made seemed swallowed instantly by the profound stillness. They walked on, leaving the world of sun and sky far behind, sinking deeper into the mountain's heart.\n[/Padding Segment]\n\n\nThey moved through the echoing silence, the pearl's light a small, fragile bubble against the vast dark. The air grew colder, carrying the scent of damp earth and something else, something mineral and sharp. Kaelen stopped, his hand raised. Against the rough stone wall, embedded in a shallow fissure, pulsed a cluster of faint blue light. Lyra knelt, her fingers tracing the cool surface of the first Sky-gems they had found in this depth. There were **three** such gems here, nestled together like tiny eggs.\n\nFurther along the passage, where a narrow vein of quartz cut through the rock, another discovery awaited. Here, the Sky-gems were smaller, like scattered seeds, but more numerous. Lyra counted them carefully in the dim light; there were **nine** in this scattered collection.\n\nThe tunnel opened into a small cavern, the air suddenly feeling vast and empty. And there, dominating the space from a pedestal of natural stone, lay a magnificent cluster of light. It wasn't just a few gems; it was a cascade of light, a breathtaking hoard. These Sky-gems were larger, more vibrant than any they had seen before, their combined glow pushing back the shadows with authority. Lyra felt a gasp catch in her throat as she took in the sheer quantity; there were **twenty-five** of these luminous treasures piled high.\n\nKaelen stepped closer, his eyes scanning the hoard, then glancing back towards the passage where they had found the smaller groups, and even further back in his mind, to the faint memory of The Mist-Pearl. The contrast was stark. The cluster on the pedestal pulsed with a power that dwarfed the others. It was clear, without question, that this last discovery was the most significant, the heart of the mountain's hoard. This was not just another collection of Sky-gems; this was the pinnacle, the ultimate expression of their quest. They knew, with a certainty that settled deep in their bones, that they had found what would henceforth be known as The Sovereign Sky-Gem.\n\n---\n\n**Question:** The story describes a sequence of operations that modify a quantifiable measure related to 'Sky-gems'.

They moved with quiet purpose, their eyes scanning the shadowed alcoves and fissures in the rock.\n\nIn a small, almost hidden niche, Lyra spotted a cluster of gems, their light a soft, steady pulse. She counted them carefully: there were **five** Sky-gems nestled together. Further into the chamber, Sister Agnes pointed towards a larger vein running across the ceiling; embedded within it were precisely **ten** gleaming stones.

There were **three** such gems here, nestled together like tiny eggs.\n\nFurther along the passage, where a narrow vein of quartz cut through the rock, another discovery awaited.

Lyra felt a gasp catch in her throat as she took in the sheer quantity; there were **twenty-five** of these luminous treasures piled high.\n\nKaelen stepped closer, his eyes scanning the hoard, then glancing back towards the passage where they had found the smaller groups, and even further back in his mind, to the faint memory of The Mist-Pearl.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as no prior calculated quantities). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Its precise numerical value ('five') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Spark' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'five' (5) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' and NOT restate 'five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister.

The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister. More hesitant.\"\nSister Agnes knelt beside her, her gaze following Lyra's. A sigh escaped her lips, thin and weary. \"They are. The light fades across all the islands. A creeping chill takes hold.\" She paused, her fingers tracing a pattern on the damp stone. \"We cannot simply wait. The old ways speak of places where the light burns brighter, where the gems are born in abundance.\"\nShe looked at Lyra, her eyes holding a plea, a silent question. \"A journey must be made. A perilous path across the mist-shrouded void, seeking the heart of the light before it is extinguished entirely.\" The air seemed to grow colder, the faint pulse of the Sky-gems nearby seeming weaker than before.

Their path led them across swaying bridges, the mist swirling below like hungry ghosts, towards the Whisperwind Peaks, a cluster of islands rumoured to hold secrets of the Sky-gems' origin. The journey was silent save for the groan of ropes and the distant cry of a mist-hawk.\n\nUpon reaching a hidden plateau, they began their search, guided by faint, almost imperceptible pulses in the air. The peaks were riddled with caves and crystalline veins. In a large cavern, they found a cluster of twenty-three Sky-gems clinging to the damp rock face, their light muted but present. Further exploration of winding passages revealed a scattered cache holding seventeen Sky-gems nestled in a bed of soft moss. Deeper still, in a hidden alcove accessible only by a narrow crawlspace, they discovered eleven Sky-gems nestled together, their surfaces cool to the touch. Near a patch of luminescent fungus that cast eerie shadows, they counted ten Sky-gems embedded in the earthy floor. Prying carefully at a vein of quartz that shimmered faintly, they managed to extract twenty-one Sky-gems. Finally, tucked away in a small, easily overlooked crevice near the cavern entrance, lay five Sky-gems, almost hidden by debris.\n\nThey gathered their findings, laying them out on a flat stone. Examining the six distinct collections before them, they compared the intensity of their glow, the purity of their colour, the subtle hum each group emitted. While some pulsed with a broad, diffused energy, others seemed to hold a more focused, intense light. The collection found in the small crevice, though the least in number, possessed a unique, concentrated luminescence that drew the eye. This smallest discovery, they realised, held the purest potential, the seed of the light itself, untainted and vibrant.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group).

OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.

Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A.

Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a.

Their path led them across swaying bridges, the mist swirling below like hungry ghosts, towards the Whisperwind Peaks, a cluster of islands rumoured to hold secrets of the Sky-gems' origin. The journey was silent save for the groan of ropes and the distant cry of a mist-hawk.\n\nUpon reaching a hidden plateau, they began their search, guided by faint, almost imperceptible pulses in the air. The peaks were riddled with caves and crystalline veins. In a large cavern, they found a cluster of twenty-three Sky-gems clinging to the damp rock face, their light muted but present. Further exploration of winding passages revealed a scattered cache holding seventeen Sky-gems nestled in a bed of soft moss. Deeper still, in a hidden alcove accessible only by a narrow crawlspace, they discovered eleven Sky-gems nestled together, their surfaces cool to the touch. Near a patch of luminescent fungus that cast eerie shadows, they counted ten Sky-gems embedded in the earthy floor. Prying carefully at a vein of quartz that shimmered faintly, they managed to extract twenty-one Sky-gems. Finally, tucked away in a small, easily overlooked crevice near the cavern entrance, lay five Sky-gems, almost hidden by debris.\n\nThey gathered their findings, laying them out on a flat stone. Examining the six distinct collections before them, they compared the intensity of their glow, the purity of their colour, the subtle hum each group emitted. While some pulsed with a broad, diffused energy, others seemed to hold a more focused, intense light. The collection found in the small crevice, though the least in number, possessed a unique, concentrated luminescence that drew the eye. This smallest discovery, they realised, held the purest potential, the seed of the light itself, untainted and vibrant. They named this potent, singular essence 'The Sky-gem's Spark', understanding that within its humble form lay the key they sought.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as no prior calculated quantities). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Its precise numerical value ('five') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Spark' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'five' (5) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' and NOT restate 'five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister.

Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister. More hesitant.\"\nSister Agnes knelt beside her, her gaze following Lyra's. A sigh escaped her lips, thin and weary. \"They are. The light fades across all the islands. A creeping chill takes hold.\" She paused, her fingers tracing a pattern on the damp stone. \"We cannot simply wait. The old ways speak of places where the light burns brighter, where the gems are born in abundance.\"\nShe looked at Lyra, her eyes holding a plea, a silent question. \"A journey must be made. A perilous path across the mist-shrouded void, seeking the heart of the light before it is extinguished entirely.\" The air seemed to grow colder, the faint pulse of the Sky-gems nearby seeming weaker than before.

The air here was thick with the scent of damp earth and something else, something faintly metallic and bright. They had followed the whispers of the old ways, seeking the source, the heartwood of the fading light. Their path led them through crumbling ruins and across narrow, moss-slicked bridges suspended over the grey abyss.\n\nDeep within a forgotten grotto, where phosphorescent fungi cast an eerie glow, they found a cluster of gems embedded in the rock face. Carefully, they extracted them, counting a yield of **twenty-three** Sky-gems, their light weak but present. Moving on, they navigated treacherous ledges to a hidden cave mouth. Inside, nestled in crystalline veins, lay another collection, numbering **seventeen** Sky-gems, pulsing with a slightly stronger luminescence. Their search continued across wind-battered peaks. Tucked beneath a collapsed archway, they uncovered a small, protected pocket holding **eleven** Sky-gems, cool and smooth to the touch. Descending into a sheltered ravine, they discovered a shallow pool reflecting the sky. Along its edge, partially submerged, they gathered **ten** Sky-gems, their surfaces slick with water. Further exploration led them to a high cliff face, where a narrow fissure opened into a small chamber. Within, they found a rich deposit of **twenty-one** Sky-gems, radiating a soft, steady light. Finally, in a quiet, unassuming hollow near the base of a towering stone spire, they found a handful of gems, small and intensely bright. There were **five** Sky-gems in this final cache.\n\nThey laid out the results of their search, the distinct piles of shimmering stones catching the faint light of the mist-shrouded realm. They had examined **six** separate locations, each yielding a different bounty. Sister Agnes knelt, her eyes scanning the collections. Her gaze settled on the smallest group, the gems within it seeming to possess a clarity and intensity the others lacked. \"This one,\" she murmured, her voice filled with quiet certainty. \"This is the core, the seed from which the others grow.\" She carefully gathered the small cluster. \"This is what the old texts spoke of. Not the largest hoard, but the essence itself.\" She held it up, its concentrated light piercing the gloom. \"This,\" she declared, \"is The Sky-gem's Spark.\"", "validator_system_prompt": "You are an AI numerical compliance checker and literary critic.\nYour ONLY task is to evaluate a story 'beat' against a provided set of ULTRA-STRICT numerical and storytelling rules.\nYou MUST output your response as a single, valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE, adhering precisely to the provided schema.\nDo not include any text, explanations, or markdown (like ```json) before the opening '{' or after the closing '}'.\nYour analysis must be meticulous, focusing on exact numerical frequencies and adherence to all specified constraints.\n", "validator_user_prompt": "You are an AI numerical compliance checker.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.

Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

The air here was thick with the scent of damp earth and something else, something faintly metallic and bright. They had followed the whispers of the old ways, seeking the source, the heartwood of the fading light. Their path led them through crumbling ruins and across narrow, moss-slicked bridges suspended over the grey abyss.\n\nDeep within a forgotten grotto, where phosphorescent fungi cast an eerie glow, they found a cluster of gems embedded in the rock face. Carefully, they extracted them, counting a yield of **twenty-three** Sky-gems, their light weak but present. Moving on, they navigated treacherous ledges to a hidden cave mouth. Inside, nestled in crystalline veins, lay another collection, numbering **seventeen** Sky-gems, pulsing with a slightly stronger luminescence. Their search continued across wind-battered peaks. Tucked beneath a collapsed archway, they uncovered a small, protected pocket holding **eleven** Sky-gems, cool and smooth to the touch. Descending into a sheltered ravine, they discovered a shallow pool reflecting the sky. Along its edge, partially submerged, they gathered **ten** Sky-gems, their surfaces slick with water. Further exploration led them to a high cliff face, where a narrow fissure opened into a small chamber. Within, they found a rich deposit of **twenty-one** Sky-gems, radiating a soft, steady light. Finally, in a quiet, unassuming hollow near the base of a towering stone spire, they found a handful of gems, small and intensely bright. There were **five** Sky-gems in this final cache.\n\nThey laid out the results of their search, the distinct piles of shimmering stones catching the faint light of the mist-shrouded realm. They had examined **six** separate locations, each yielding a different bounty. Sister Agnes knelt, her eyes scanning the collections. Her gaze settled on the smallest group, the gems within it seeming to possess a clarity and intensity the others lacked. \"This one,\" she murmured, her voice filled with quiet certainty. \"This is the core, the seed from which the others grow.\" She carefully gathered the small cluster. \"This is what the old texts spoke of. Not the largest hoard, but the essence itself.\" She held it up, its concentrated light piercing the gloom. \"This,\" she declared, \"is The Sky-gem's Spark.\"\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as no prior calculated quantities). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Its precise numerical value ('five') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Spark' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'five' (5) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' and NOT restate 'five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister.

This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister. More hesitant.\"\nSister Agnes knelt beside her, her gaze following Lyra's. A sigh escaped her lips, thin and weary. \"They are. The light fades across all the islands. A creeping chill takes hold.\" She paused, her fingers tracing a pattern on the damp stone. \"We cannot simply wait. The old ways speak of places where the light burns brighter, where the gems are born in abundance.\"\nShe looked at Lyra, her eyes holding a plea, a silent question. \"A journey must be made. A perilous path across the mist-shrouded void, seeking the heart of the light before it is extinguished entirely.\" The air seemed to grow colder, the faint pulse of the Sky-gems nearby seeming weaker than before.

They descended into a forgotten vault, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and old magic. Dust motes danced in the narrow beam of Sister Agnes's lantern, illuminating walls carved with symbols of creation and decay.\n\n\"The old texts speak of a place where the first lights were gathered,\" Sister Agnes murmured, her voice echoing softly. \"Perhaps here, we can understand the nature of the fading, and find the key to rekindling the flame.\"\n\nThey moved through crumbling passages, the silence broken only by their footsteps and the distant drip of water. Then, the lantern light caught a faint shimmer ahead. They found a small, hidden cavity containing a cluster of Sky-gems, numbering **eleven**. Further on, nestled within a fractured crystal formation, lay another collection, this one holding **twenty-three** gems.\n\nAs they ventured deeper, a narrow fissure opened into a small grotto. Here, resting on a bed of luminous moss, they discovered a delicate arrangement of **five** Sky-gems. In a larger chamber beyond, tucked within a collapsed section of the ceiling, was a cache of **ten** gems. Their search continued, revealing a vein running through the rock face where **twenty-one** Sky-gems pulsed with a faint, internal light. Finally, near the vault's deepest point, they unearthed a significant deposit of **seventeen** gems, buried beneath layers of sediment.\n\nThey stood before the **six** distinct groups they had uncovered, the air humming with the combined, albeit weak, energy of the stones. Sister Agnes knelt, her gaze sweeping over each find – the cluster of **eleven**, the collection of **twenty-three**, the delicate arrangement of **five**, the cache of **ten**, the vein of **twenty-one**, and the deposit of **seventeen**. She studied their size, their arrangement, the quality of their light.\n\n\"Look closely, Lyra,\" she said, her voice hushed. \"Among all these, one group holds a unique resonance. It is the seed, the fundamental unit from which the greater lights grow.\"\n\nHer finger pointed towards the smallest arrangement. It seemed to vibrate with a purer, more focused energy, a concentrated point of potential amidst the larger, more diffuse quantities.\n\n\"This,\" Sister Agnes declared, her eyes alight with understanding, \"this is the core.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.

Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as no prior calculated quantities). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Its precise numerical value ('five') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Spark' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'five' (5) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' and NOT restate 'five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister.

If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.'

Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as no prior calculated quantities). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Its precise numerical value ('five') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Spark' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'five' (5) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' and NOT restate 'five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister.

This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.

Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4?

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as no prior calculated quantities). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Its precise numerical value ('five') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Spark' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'five' (5) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' and NOT restate 'five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister.

The air here felt different, heavy with the scent of damp rock and something else, something ancient and dormant. This was one of the 'places of abundance' the old texts spoke of, though this chamber seemed long forgotten. They moved with quiet purpose, their eyes scanning the shadowed alcoves and fissures in the rock.\n\nIn a small, almost hidden niche, Lyra spotted a cluster of gems, their light a soft, steady pulse. She counted them carefully: there were **five** Sky-gems nestled together. Further into the chamber, Sister Agnes pointed towards a larger vein running across the ceiling; embedded within it were precisely **ten** gleaming stones. Deeper still, in a collapsed section, they unearthed another collection, numbering **eleven** in total.\n\nTheir search led them to a narrow passage where the air grew colder. Here, clinging to the damp walls, they found **seventeen** gems, their glow faint but persistent. A larger, central cavern yielded the most impressive find yet, a shimmering deposit containing **twenty-one** Sky-gems. Finally, near the chamber's exit, almost overlooked, was a scattering of **twenty-three** stones, their light diffused across the floor.\n\nThey paused, looking at the various sources they had discovered.

SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., None) and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The air here felt different, heavy with the scent of damp rock and something else, something ancient and dormant. This chamber was a 'place of abundance' the old texts spoke of, though it seemed long forgotten. They moved with quiet purpose, their eyes scanning the shadowed alcoves and fissures in the rock.\n\nIn a small, almost hidden niche, Lyra spotted a cluster of gems, their light a soft, steady pulse. She counted them carefully: there were **five** Sky-gems nestled together. Further into the chamber, Sister Agnes pointed towards a larger vein running across the ceiling; embedded within it were precisely **ten** gleaming stones. Deeper still, in a collapsed section, they unearthed another collection, numbering **eleven** in total.\n\nTheir search led them to a narrow passage where the air grew colder. Here, clinging to the damp walls, they found **seventeen** gems, their glow faint but persistent. A larger, central cavern yielded the most impressive find yet, a shimmering deposit containing **twenty-one** Sky-gems. Finally, near the chamber's exit, almost overlooked, was a scattering of **twenty-three** stones, their light diffused across the floor.\n\nThey paused, looking at the various sources they had discovered. Each held a different intensity, a different presence. They needed to understand the core, the fundamental spark that fueled the greater light. Their gaze settled upon the smallest, most contained cluster. It was here, in this humble gathering, that they felt the purest, most concentrated essence of the light's potential. This, they knew, was not just a collection of gems; it was the fundamental flicker, the origin point they sought.

Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.

Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2.

(e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3.

If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat?

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nImagine your characters are gathering or combining distinct collections of 'Sky-gems'. Some of these collections might be newly found or counted, corresponding to the numbers (and their frequencies): 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18). Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Spark') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred sixteen') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred sixteen' (116) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Celestial Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.

This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.

Careful work with a small tool revealed a cluster of **six** Sky-gems, nestled together like tiny, frozen stars.

Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one hundred sixteen' (116)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-gem's Spark') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The air grew colder, carrying the mineral tang of ancient stone and the promise of hidden things. They moved cautiously, their footsteps echoing softly in the oppressive silence. Their task was clear: seek the scattered remnants, the lost sparks that might guide them deeper.\n\nNear a narrow fissure, where the rock face wept with moisture, Lyra’s light caught a gleam. Careful work with a small tool revealed a cluster of **six** Sky-gems, nestled together like tiny, frozen stars. Sister Agnes marked the location on a rough parchment.\n\nFurther on, as the passage widened into a small, irregular chamber, Sister Agnes pointed towards a natural shelf high on the wall. Climbing carefully, she found **nine** Sky-gems resting there, almost invisible against the dark stone.\n\nThe floor sloped downwards sharply. At the bottom of the incline, scattered across the damp earth like fallen dew, were **fifteen** Sky-gems, their light muted by the surrounding gloom.\n\nThey navigated a section where the passage narrowed drastically, forcing them to squeeze through. Pressed into a seam in the low ceiling, requiring Lyra to reach high and scrape gently, she dislodged **eighteen** Sky-gems, which tumbled into her waiting pouch.\n\nRounding a sharp bend, they entered a small grotto. In the center, a shallow pool of water collected, and submerged within its clear depths were another **eighteen** Sky-gems, their internal light amplified by the liquid.\n\nA side tunnel branched off, barely large enough to crawl through. Exploring it briefly, they discovered **nineteen** Sky-gems embedded in a patch of strange, faintly glowing moss.\n\nFinally, the main passage opened into a larger, echoing cavern. Strewn across a raised, altar-like platform were **twenty-six** Sky-gems, a significant find that seemed to pulse with a deeper energy.\n\nThey gathered these newly found collections, adding them to the pouch that already held the precious outcome known as The Sky-gem's Spark. They brought the **eight** distinct collections together onto the central platform, arranging them carefully. As the final Sky-gems were placed, a low hum vibrated through the stone, and the combined light of the gems intensified, swirling and merging into a single, radiant core of pure light. It pulsed with immense power, a beacon in the deep dark, clearly becoming something new, something greater. This powerful accumulation, they knew, was The Celestial Core.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nImagine your characters are gathering or combining distinct collections of 'Sky-gems'. Some of these collections might be newly found or counted, corresponding to the numbers (and their frequencies): 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18). Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Spark') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred sixteen') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred sixteen' (116) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Celestial Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nImagine your characters are gathering or combining distinct collections of 'Sky-gems'. Some of these collections might be newly found or counted, corresponding to the numbers (and their frequencies): 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18). Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Spark') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred sixteen') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred sixteen' (116) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Celestial Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The gentle light of the chamber receded behind them, leaving the passage ahead in absolute shadow.

Hours seemed to pass in the oppressive dark.\n\nDeep within the mountain's heart, the air grew colder still, carrying a faint, resonant hum. They reached a small, natural cavern. Here, embedded in the rock face, they found a cluster of **six** Sky-gems, their faint internal light a stark contrast to the surrounding gloom. Carefully, they pried them free, adding them to a leather pouch. Further exploration of the cavern revealed a narrow fissure; within it lay a small vein of gems, yielding **nine** more.\n\nPressing deeper into the network of tunnels, they stumbled upon the remnants of a long-forgotten camp. Beside a crumbling campfire pit, a sturdy, sealed chest lay half-buried. Prying it open revealed a hoard of **twenty-six** Sky-gems, glowing with a soft, steady light. In a nearby alcove, tucked away from sight, they discovered a worn leather pouch, likely left behind by the previous occupants, containing **fifteen** perfectly formed gems.\n\nContinuing their descent, the tunnel opened into a wider, echoing chamber. The hum intensified here, vibrating through the stone. Scattered across the floor, as if dropped in haste, were **nineteen** Sky-gems, their light pulsing in time with the chamber's resonance. Along one wall, a significant pocket of gems was uncovered, embedded deep within the crystalline structure of the rock, containing **eighteen** brilliant stones. On the opposite side of the chamber, another, equally rich deposit held **eighteen** more, requiring careful excavation to retrieve.\n\nGathering the newly found gems, Lyra and Sister Agnes brought them together with The Sky-gem's Spark they carried from the previous chamber. The **eight** distinct collections of light merged, swirling and combining in the center of the chamber. The individual glows intensified, flowing into a single, radiant mass.

Lyra extended a hand, feeling only the damp, rough stone of the passage wall. Sister Agnes produced a small, hooded lantern, its weak light pushing back the void only slightly, revealing a narrow tunnel sloping downwards. They moved cautiously, boots crunching on loose scree. Hours seemed to pass in the oppressive dark.\n\nDeep within the mountain's heart, the air grew colder still, carrying a faint, resonant hum. They reached a small, natural cavern. Here, embedded in the rock face, they found a cluster of **six** Sky-gems, their faint internal light a stark contrast to the surrounding gloom. Carefully, they pried them free, adding them to a leather pouch. Further exploration of the cavern revealed a narrow fissure; within it lay a small vein of gems, yielding **nine** more.\n\nPressing deeper into the network of tunnels, they stumbled upon the remnants of a long-forgotten camp. Beside a crumbling campfire pit, a sturdy, sealed chest lay half-buried. Prying it open revealed a hoard of **twenty-six** Sky-gems, glowing with a soft, steady light. In a nearby alcove, tucked away from sight, they discovered a worn leather pouch, likely left behind by the previous occupants, containing **fifteen** perfectly formed gems.\n\nContinuing their descent, the tunnel opened into a wider, echoing chamber. The hum intensified here, vibrating through the stone. Scattered across the floor, as if dropped in haste, were **nineteen** Sky-gems, their light pulsing in time with the chamber's resonance. Along one wall, a significant pocket of gems was uncovered, embedded deep within the crystalline structure of the rock, containing **eighteen** brilliant stones. On the opposite side of the chamber, another, equally rich deposit held **eighteen** more, requiring careful excavation to retrieve.\n\nGathering the newly found gems, Lyra and Sister Agnes brought them together with The Sky-gem's Spark they carried from the previous chamber. The **eight** distinct collections of light merged, swirling and combining in the center of the chamber. The individual glows intensified, flowing into a single, radiant mass. As the light stabilized, it formed a luminous sphere, pulsing with immense power. This unified, brilliant accumulation was clearly something new, something potent, something worthy of a name whispered only in ancient texts: The Celestial Core.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nImagine your characters are gathering or combining distinct collections of 'Sky-gems'. Some of these collections might be newly found or counted, corresponding to the numbers (and their frequencies): 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18). Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Spark') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred sixteen') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred sixteen' (116) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Celestial Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The gentle light of the chamber receded behind them, leaving the passage ahead in absolute shadow.

Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The gentle light of the chamber receded behind them, leaving the passage ahead in absolute shadow. It was not merely dark, but a palpable absence of light, a hungry void that seemed to absorb even the faint luminescence clinging to their clothes. The air here was heavy, damp, and colder than the cavern they had just left, carrying the unmistakable scent of deep, undisturbed earth and mineral deposits. Lyra felt a prickle of apprehension crawl across her skin, a primal unease at the unknown that lay hidden within the unyielding blackness. Beside her, Sister Agnes was a silent, steady presence, her breathing calm, her gaze fixed on the entrance as if peering into the very heart of the mountain. The silence between them was complete, a shared acknowledgment of the daunting path that awaited, shrouded in mystery and the promise of what lay beneath the world they knew....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly.

Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one hundred sixteen' (116)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

Deeper still, near a section of wall weeping with moisture, they located another distinct cache, this one holding **eighteen** Sky-gems. Entering a small, naturally formed chamber, they found **nine** Sky-gems scattered across the smooth stone floor. And finally, in a shallow depression near the chamber's center, lay **fifteen** Sky-gems, almost entirely obscured by dust.\n\nCarefully gathering each find, they brought them together at a designated spot, adding these newly discovered collections to the radiant heart of The Sky-gem's Spark, which pulsed with a gentle, familiar power. The luminescence grew as the **eight** distinct contributions were combined. The cluster, the pocket, the fissure's yield, the two caches, the scattered gems, the final group, and the enduring light of The Sky-gem's Spark merged into a single, breathtaking accumulation. The light intensified, shifting from the individual glows of the scattered finds to a unified, profound radiance. This new, vibrant mass of light and energy settled, coalescing into something greater than the sum of its parts, something they knew instantly as The Celestial Core. Its brilliance pushed back the oppressive darkness, filling the chamber with a soft, powerful light.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nImagine your characters are gathering or combining distinct collections of 'Sky-gems'. Some of these collections might be newly found or counted, corresponding to the numbers (and their frequencies): 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18). Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Spark') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred sixteen') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred sixteen' (116) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Celestial Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The gentle light of the chamber receded behind them, leaving the passage ahead in absolute shadow.

(e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The gentle light of the chamber receded behind them, leaving the passage ahead in absolute shadow. It was not merely dark, but a palpable absence of light, a hungry void that seemed to absorb even the faint luminescence clinging to their clothes. The air here was heavy, damp, and colder than the cavern they had just left, carrying the unmistakable scent of deep, undisturbed earth and mineral deposits. Lyra felt a prickle of apprehension crawl across her skin, a primal unease at the unknown that lay hidden within the unyielding blackness. Beside her, Sister Agnes was a silent, steady presence, her breathing calm, her gaze fixed on the entrance as if peering into the very heart of the mountain. The silence between them was complete, a shared acknowledgment of the daunting path that awaited, shrouded in mystery and the promise of what lay beneath the world they knew....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly.

They navigated narrow fissures and low-ceilinged tunnels, the silence broken only by their careful footsteps and the drip of unseen water.\n\nAfter what felt like an age, the passage widened into a small grotto. Nestled within a crystalline growth on the far wall glowed a cluster of Sky-gems, their light faint but undeniable. Lyra counted them carefully: a small gathering of **six**. She gently extracted them, their cool surfaces smooth under her touch. Further along, the tunnel floor gave way slightly, revealing a narrow vein of rock shot through with the luminous gems. Sister Agnes, with practiced hands, worked them free, uncovering **nine** more.\n\nThe passage twisted again, leading them to a chamber where the air felt warmer, humming with latent energy. In the center sat a tarnished metal chest. Inside, cushioned on faded velvet, lay **nineteen** Sky-gems, their combined glow brighter than the lantern. They added these to a pouch Lyra carried. Moving deeper still, they found a section of wall that shimmered faintly. Touching it revealed a hidden compartment, and within it, **eighteen** Sky-gems were stacked neatly.\n\nTheir path continued, descending into a larger cavern filled with strange, silent rock formations. One particularly large outcropping seemed to pulse with a soft light. Closer inspection revealed it was studded with **eighteen** Sky-gems, embedded as if growing from the stone itself.

Untying the drawstring, they found it filled with **fifteen** Sky-gems, each one perfect and radiant.\n\nThe final discovery in this deep place was startling. A shallow pool of still, clear water lay in a depression in the floor. Submerged within its depths, their light amplified by the liquid, were **twenty-six** Sky-gems, resting like scattered stars. They collected these last ones, adding them to the growing weight in Lyra's pouch.\n\nWith the newly found gems secured, they paused. Sister Agnes gestured towards the pouch, then towards Lyra's belt where 'The Sky-gem's Spark' was attached. Now, they would bring these new discoveries together with the energy already gathered. The **eight** distinct collections – the initial Spark and the seven they had just unearthed – were carefully combined. As the gems mingled, a profound resonance filled the chamber, a deep thrumming that vibrated through bone and stone.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one hundred sixteen' (116)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-gem's Spark') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Spark') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred sixteen') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred sixteen' (116) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Celestial Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The gentle light of the chamber receded behind them, leaving the passage ahead in absolute shadow. It was not merely dark, but a palpable absence of light, a hungry void that seemed to absorb even the faint luminescence clinging to their clothes. The air here was heavy, damp, and colder than the cavern they had just left, carrying the unmistakable scent of deep, undisturbed earth and mineral deposits. Lyra felt a prickle of apprehension crawl across her skin, a primal unease at the unknown that lay hidden within the unyielding blackness. Beside her, Sister Agnes was a silent, steady presence, her breathing calm, her gaze fixed on the entrance as if peering into the very heart of the mountain. The silence between them was complete, a shared acknowledgment of the daunting path that awaited, shrouded in mystery and the promise of what lay beneath the world they knew....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly.

The air grew thick with the scent of ancient stone and the faint, sweet tang of raw magic. Sister Agnes produced a small, hooded lantern, its light barely pushing back the gloom, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with unseen things. They navigated narrow fissures and low-ceilinged tunnels, the silence broken only by their careful footsteps and the drip of unseen water.\n\nAfter what felt like an age, the passage widened into a small grotto. Nestled within a crystalline growth on the far wall glowed a cluster of Sky-gems, their light faint but undeniable. Lyra counted them carefully: a small gathering of **six**. She gently extracted them, their cool surfaces smooth under her touch. Further along, the tunnel floor gave way slightly, revealing a narrow vein of rock shot through with the luminous gems. Sister Agnes, with practiced hands, worked them free, uncovering **nine** more.\n\nThe passage twisted again, leading them to a chamber where the air felt warmer, humming with latent energy. In the center sat a tarnished metal chest. Inside, cushioned on faded velvet, lay **nineteen** Sky-gems, their combined glow brighter than the lantern. They added these to a pouch Lyra carried. Moving deeper still, they found a section of wall that shimmered faintly. Touching it revealed a hidden compartment, and within it, **eighteen** Sky-gems were stacked neatly.\n\nTheir path continued, descending into a larger cavern filled with strange, silent rock formations. One particularly large outcropping seemed to pulse with a soft light. Closer inspection revealed it was studded with **eighteen** Sky-gems, embedded as if growing from the stone itself. Carefully, they gathered these as well. In a corner of the cavern, partially obscured by fallen rock, they discovered a leather pouch. Untying the drawstring, they found it filled with **fifteen** Sky-gems, each one perfect and radiant.\n\nThe final discovery in this deep place was startling. A shallow pool of still, clear water lay in a depression in the floor. Submerged within its depths, their light amplified by the liquid, were **twenty-six** Sky-gems, resting like scattered stars. They collected these last ones, adding them to the growing weight in Lyra's pouch.\n\nWith the newly found gems secured, they paused. Sister Agnes gestured towards the pouch, then towards Lyra's belt where 'The Sky-gem's Spark' was attached. Now, they would bring these new discoveries together with the energy already gathered. The **eight** distinct collections – the initial Spark and the seven they had just unearthed – were carefully combined. As the gems mingled, a profound resonance filled the chamber, a deep thrumming that vibrated through bone and stone. The combined light intensified, swirling and merging until it formed a single, pulsing heart of pure luminescence within the pouch. This newly formed, potent accumulation of power was something more than the sum of its parts, something vital and central to their quest. It was, Lyra realized with awe, 'The Celestial Core'.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 5. Focus on: removing the extraneous number 'seven'.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous number 'seven' (value: 7) was found. It is not justified by Rule 1.A (as it is not one of the required input values), not explicitly permitted by Rule 3 (which only allows 'one', 'two', 'three' sparingly and 'eight' for arity), and not explicitly forbidden by Rule 4. Rule 5 strictly prohibits any numbers not covered by Rules 1-4. The phrase containing the extraneous number is: 'The eight distinct collections – the initial Spark and the seven they had just unearthed – were carefully combined.' All required numbers from Rule 1.A ('six', 'nine', 'fifteen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen', 'twenty-six') were present with the exact required frequencies. Rule 2 was met as the result ('one hundred sixteen') was not explicitly stated but implied via 'The Celestial Core'. Rule 3 was met for the use of 'eight' for the arity count. Rule 4 was met as no forbidden numbers were found. Rule 6 was met as the prior result was referred to by name.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. Remove the number 'seven' from the sentence 'The eight distinct collections – the initial Spark and the seven they had just unearthed – were carefully combined.'

For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one hundred sixteen' (116)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-gem's Spark') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The air grew thick with the scent of ancient stone and the faint, sweet tang of raw magic. Sister Agnes produced a small, hooded lantern, its light barely pushing back the gloom, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with unseen things. They navigated narrow fissures and low-ceilinged tunnels, the silence broken only by their careful footsteps and the drip of unseen water.\n\nAfter what felt like an age, the passage widened into a small grotto. Nestled within a crystalline growth on the far wall glowed a cluster of Sky-gems, their light faint but undeniable. Lyra counted them carefully: a small gathering of **six**. She gently extracted them, their cool surfaces smooth under her touch. Further along, the tunnel floor gave way slightly, revealing a narrow vein of rock shot through with the luminous gems. Sister Agnes, with practiced hands, worked them free, uncovering **nine** more.\n\nThe passage twisted again, leading them to a chamber where the air felt warmer, humming with latent energy. In the center sat a tarnished metal chest. Inside, cushioned on faded velvet, lay **nineteen** Sky-gems, their combined glow brighter than the lantern. They added these to a pouch Lyra carried. Moving deeper still, they found a section of wall that shimmered faintly. Touching it revealed a hidden compartment, and within it, **eighteen** Sky-gems were stacked neatly.\n\nTheir path continued, descending into a larger cavern filled with strange, silent rock formations. One particularly large outcropping seemed to pulse with a soft light. Closer inspection revealed it was studded with **eighteen** Sky-gems, embedded as if growing from the stone itself. Carefully, they gathered these as well. In a corner of the cavern, partially obscured by fallen rock, they discovered a leather pouch. Untying the drawstring, they found it filled with **fifteen** Sky-gems, each one perfect and radiant.\n\nThe final discovery in this deep place was startling. A shallow pool of still, clear water lay in a depression in the floor. Submerged within its depths, their light amplified by the liquid, were **twenty-six** Sky-gems, resting like scattered stars. They collected these last ones, adding them to the growing weight in Lyra's pouch.\n\nWith the newly found gems secured, they paused. Sister Agnes gestured towards the pouch, then towards Lyra's belt where 'The Sky-gem's Spark' was attached. Now, they would bring these new discoveries together with the energy already gathered. The **eight** distinct collections – the initial Spark and the ones they had just unearthed – were carefully combined. As the gems mingled, a profound resonance filled the chamber, a deep thrumming that vibrated through bone and stone. The combined light intensified, swirling and merging until it formed a single, pulsing heart of pure luminescence within the pouch. This newly formed, potent accumulation of power was something more than the sum of its parts, something vital and central to their quest. It was, Lyra realized with awe, 'The Celestial Core'.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Spark') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred sixteen') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred sixteen' (116) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Celestial Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nImagine your characters are gathering or combining distinct collections of 'Sky-gems'. Some of these collections might be newly found or counted, corresponding to the numbers (and their frequencies): 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18). Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Spark') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred sixteen') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred sixteen' (116) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Celestial Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement?

Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat?

For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one hundred sixteen' (116)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-gem's Spark') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met. False otherwise.\n\n-   **`explanation_for_generator` (string):**\n    *   If invalid, provide a DETAILED, step-by-step explanation of ALL violations found.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nImagine your characters are gathering or combining distinct collections of 'Sky-gems'. Some of these collections might be newly found or counted, corresponding to the numbers (and their frequencies): 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18). Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Spark') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred sixteen') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred sixteen' (116) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Celestial Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The gentle light of the chamber receded behind them, leaving the passage ahead in absolute shadow. It was not merely dark, but a palpable absence of light, a hungry void that seemed to absorb even the faint luminescence clinging to their clothes.

Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one hundred sixteen' (116)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-gem's Spark') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' (representing the value 'five'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'nine' (9) and 'twelve' (12) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative.

They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n\nThey reached a small cavern where sixteen Sky-gems lay clustered on a crystalline shelf, their light adding to the chamber's glow. Further along, nestled in a glowing crevice, they found a cache of twelve Sky-gems, cool and smooth to the touch. Rounding a bend, another distinct pocket held precisely twelve Sky-gems, pulsating faintly in unison. Near a humming resonance point, a scattered handful yielded nine Sky-gems, each one singing a low, resonant note. Finally, deep within a radiant geode, a substantial hoard contained thirty Sky-gems, their combined brilliance almost blinding. Carefully, they gathered these new finds, bringing them back to the central platform where 'The Celestial Core' rested, its light steady and profound. As the newly collected gems were placed alongside 'The Celestial Core', the chamber's radiance shifted. The light didn't just brighten; it began to *dance*. A complex pattern of illumination and shadow swept through the air, resolving into a repeating sequence. It was a rhythm of light, a cycle of intensity that seemed to beat with a fundamental pulse, revealing the underlying essence of the combined energies. This newly perceived, cyclical state resonated through the chamber, a clear, unwavering beat that spoke of the gems' deepest truth.", "validator_system_prompt": "You are an AI numerical compliance checker and literary critic.\nYour ONLY task is to evaluate a story 'beat' against a provided set of ULTRA-STRICT numerical and storytelling rules.\nYou MUST output your response as a single, valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE, adhering precisely to the provided schema.\nDo not include any text, explanations, or markdown (like ```json) before the opening '{' or after the closing '}'.\nYour analysis must be meticulous, focusing on exact numerical frequencies and adherence to all specified constraints.\n", "validator_user_prompt": "You are an AI numerical compliance checker.

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'nine' (9) and 'twelve' (12) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met. False otherwise.\n\n-   **`explanation_for_generator` (string):**\n    *   If invalid, provide a DETAILED, step-by-step explanation of ALL violations found.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Celestial Core'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Sky-gems' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle.

Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The polished rock beneath their boots felt smooth, almost warm through the worn leather.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Celestial Core'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Sky-gems' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' (representing the value 'five'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'nine' (9) and 'twelve' (12) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names.

The chamber walls seemed to pulse with the light, the crystalline growths shimmering like frozen fire. They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n\nAhead, the source of the light resolved into a complex structure, resonating with the familiar energy of The Celestial Core. As they approached, other concentrations of power became visible within the chamber. Nestled in a high crystalline arch was a collection of sixteen Sky-gems, pulsing softly. On a low, natural pedestal nearby lay a cluster of twelve Sky-gems, their facets catching the light in dazzling array. Further along the wall, embedded in a vein of shimmering quartz, they discovered another distinct group of twelve Sky-gems, mirroring the first in their quiet glow. In a small, shadowed alcove, a hidden hoard of nine Sky-gems cast a faint, internal luminescence. Finally, at the very center of the chamber, a significant mound, almost a small hillock of pure energy, contained thirty Sky-gems, their combined radiance overwhelming.\n\nAs the energies from these disparate sources – The Celestial Core, the sixteen from the arch, the twelve from the pedestal, the twelve from the wall, the nine from the alcove, and the thirty at the center – converged in the chamber's heart, the light didn't just brighten; it changed its very nature. The chaotic brilliance resolved into a rhythmic pattern. A distinct, steady pulse began to emanate from the central convergence point.

The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The light intensified, washing over them in waves of pure, vibrant amber. It seemed to penetrate their very being, warming them from within, chasing away any lingering chill. The air grew heavier, scented now with a faint sweetness that mingled with the ozone tang. Lyra felt a lightness settle in her chest, a sense of profound peace she hadn't known existed. Beside her, Sister Agnes moved with quiet grace, her gaze fixed ahead, a serene expression on her face. The chamber walls seemed to pulse with the light, the crystalline growths shimmering like frozen fire. They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n\nAhead, the source of the light resolved into a complex structure, resonating with the familiar energy of The Celestial Core. As they approached, other concentrations of power became visible within the chamber. Nestled in a high crystalline arch was a collection of sixteen Sky-gems, pulsing softly. On a low, natural pedestal nearby lay a cluster of twelve Sky-gems, their facets catching the light in dazzling array. Further along the wall, embedded in a vein of shimmering quartz, they discovered another distinct group of twelve Sky-gems, mirroring the first in their quiet glow. In a small, shadowed alcove, a hidden hoard of nine Sky-gems cast a faint, internal luminescence. Finally, at the very center of the chamber, a significant mound, almost a small hillock of pure energy, contained thirty Sky-gems, their combined radiance overwhelming.\n\nAs the energies from these disparate sources – The Celestial Core, the sixteen from the arch, the twelve from the pedestal, the twelve from the wall, the nine from the alcove, and the thirty at the center – converged in the chamber's heart, the light didn't just brighten; it changed its very nature. The chaotic brilliance resolved into a rhythmic pattern. A distinct, steady pulse began to emanate from the central convergence point. It wasn't a flicker or a surge, but a clear, repeating sequence, like the beat of a hidden heart within the stone. This consistent, cyclical rhythm, they understood instantly, was the fundamental essence, the true, unwavering frequency that emerged when all the chamber's energies aligned. This, Lyra realized, was The Sky-Gem's True Pulse.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": false, "explanation_for_generator": "VIOLATION Rule 1.B (Re-listing): Detected a phrase that re-lists/summarizes input numbers, likely causing frequency errors for Rule 1.A.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Celestial Core'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Sky-gems' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' (representing the value 'five'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'nine' (9) and 'twelve' (12) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5.

The light intensified, washing over them in waves of pure, vibrant amber. It seemed to penetrate their very being, warming them from within, chasing away any lingering chill. The air grew heavier, scented now with a faint sweetness that mingled with the ozone tang. Lyra felt a lightness settle in her chest, a sense of profound peace she hadn't known existed. Beside her, Sister Agnes moved with quiet grace, her gaze fixed ahead, a serene expression on her face. The chamber walls seemed to pulse with the light, the crystalline growths shimmering like frozen fire. They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n\nAhead, the source of the light resolved into a complex structure, resonating with the familiar energy of The Celestial Core. As they approached, other concentrations of power became visible within the chamber. Nestled in a high crystalline arch was a collection of sixteen Sky-gems, pulsing softly. On a low, natural pedestal nearby lay a cluster of twelve Sky-gems, their facets catching the light in dazzling array. Further along the wall, embedded in a vein of shimmering quartz, they discovered another distinct group of twelve Sky-gems, mirroring the first in their quiet glow. In a small, shadowed alcove, a hidden hoard of nine Sky-gems cast a faint, internal luminescence. Finally, at the very center of the chamber, a significant mound, almost a small hillock of pure energy, contained thirty Sky-gems, their combined radiance overwhelming.\n\nAs the energies from these disparate sources – The Celestial Core, the sixteen from the arch, the twelve from the pedestal, the twelve from the wall, the nine from the alcove, and the thirty at the center – converged in the chamber's heart, the light didn't just brighten; it changed its very nature. The chaotic brilliance resolved into a rhythmic pattern. A distinct, steady pulse began to emanate from the central convergence point. It wasn't a flicker or a surge, but a clear, repeating sequence, like the beat of a hidden heart within the stone. This consistent, cyclical rhythm, they understood instantly, was the fundamental essence, the true, unwavering frequency that emerged when all the chamber's energies aligned. This, Lyra realized, was The Sky-Gem's True Pulse.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.B (Re-listing).

Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'nine' (9) and 'twelve' (12) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The light intensified, washing over them in waves of pure, vibrant amber. It seemed to penetrate their very being, warming them from within, chasing away any lingering chill. The air grew heavier, scented now with a faint sweetness that mingled with the ozone tang. Lyra felt a lightness settle in her chest, a sense of profound peace she hadn't known existed. Beside her, Sister Agnes moved with quiet grace, her gaze fixed ahead, a serene expression on her face. The chamber walls seemed to pulse with the light, the crystalline growths shimmering like frozen fire. They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n\nAhead, the source of the light resolved into a complex structure, resonating with the familiar energy of The Celestial Core. As they approached, other concentrations of power became visible within the chamber. Nestled in a high crystalline arch was a collection of sixteen Sky-gems, pulsing softly. On a low, natural pedestal nearby lay a cluster of twelve Sky-gems, their facets catching the light in dazzling array. Further along the wall, embedded in a vein of shimmering quartz, they discovered another distinct group of twelve Sky-gems, mirroring the first in their quiet glow.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Celestial Core'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Sky-gems' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' (representing the value 'five'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'nine' (9) and 'twelve' (12) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The polished rock beneath their boots felt smooth, almost warm through the worn leather.

SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'nine' (9) and 'twelve' (12) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met. False otherwise.\n\n-   **`explanation_for_generator` (string):**\n    *   If invalid, provide a DETAILED, step-by-step explanation of ALL violations found.

The light intensified, washing over them in waves of pure, vibrant amber. It seemed to penetrate their very being, warming them from within, chasing away any lingering chill. The air grew heavier, scented now with a faint sweetness that mingled with the ozone tang. Lyra felt a lightness settle in her chest, a sense of profound peace she hadn't known existed. Beside her, Sister Agnes moved with quiet grace, her gaze fixed ahead, a serene expression on her face. The chamber walls seemed to pulse with the light, the crystalline growths shimmering like frozen fire. They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n\nAhead, the source of the light resolved into a complex structure, resonating with the familiar energy of The Celestial Core. As they approached, other concentrations of power became visible within the chamber. Nestled in a high crystalline arch was a collection of sixteen Sky-gems, pulsing softly. On a low, natural pedestal nearby lay a cluster of twelve Sky-gems, their facets catching the light in dazzling array. Further along the wall, embedded in a vein of shimmering quartz, they discovered another distinct group of twelve Sky-gems, mirroring the first in their quiet glow. In a small, shadowed alcove, a hidden hoard of nine Sky-gems cast a faint, internal luminescence. Finally, at the very center of the chamber, a significant mound, almost a small hillock of pure energy, contained thirty Sky-gems, their combined radiance overwhelming.\n\nAs the energies converged in the chamber's heart, the chaotic brilliance resolved into a rhythmic pattern. A distinct, steady pulse began to emanate from the central convergence point. It wasn't a flicker or a surge, but a clear, repeating sequence. As they watched, the light coalesced into a shimmering form that resolved into a core, completing a pattern before dissolving and reforming. This consistent, cyclical rhythm, they understood instantly, was the fundamental essence, the true, unwavering frequency that emerged when all the chamber's energies aligned. This, Lyra realized, was The Sky-Gem's True Pulse.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.'

It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.'

This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'.

The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.

This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints.

Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound stillness held them captive.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'sixteen' (16)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound stillness held them captive. The air, thick with ancient power, hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the very core of their being.

Kaelen remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent witness to the unveiled secret.

This revision MUST meticulously address all issues identified by the validator below, while also re-adhering to ALL original rules for this scene. Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**\n```text\nThey turned their attention to the array of Sky-gems before them, each cluster radiating a unique frequency, a distinct count. One held a mere seven gems, their light a soft, steady hum. Another, nestled in a crystalline growth further along the chamber wall, contained thirteen, their glow a deeper blue. Near the chamber's edge, a shimmering vein pulsed with sixteen gems, their light a calm, even rhythm. High on a wall, twenty-seven gems glowed faintly, a distant constellation of power. A large formation in the very center of the space displayed twenty-eight, their combined energy a powerful thrum. And deepest within the chamber, almost hidden, a powerful nexus pulsed with thirty, their light a blinding white intensity. Kaelen stepped forward, his eyes scanning the disparate clusters, his mind weighing their varied counts. He pointed towards the vein near the edge, the one with the sixteen gems. \"This one,\" he stated, his voice low, \"holds the balance.\" Lyra felt the truth of his words resonate through the quiet air. Among all the varied counts, this specific cluster represented the central point, the stable core around which the others seemed to orbit. \"This,\" Kaelen declared, the name settling into the space with quiet authority, \"is The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.\"\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2 (Explicit Result), Rule 4 (Forbidden Number), Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number). Focus on: exact counts for required inputs (especially 'sixteen'), ensuring the result ('sixteen') is only implied and named 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' without using the number again, and removing the forbidden number 'one'.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'sixteen' (value: 16) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'sixteen' (value: 16) was explicitly stated again ('the one with the sixteen gems') when identifying the group that represents the result, but should be implicit via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' without re-using the number. The single required mention of 'sixteen' under Rule 1.A is for the input group; identifying the outcome group numerically violates Rule 2.    - VIOLATION Rule 4 (Forbidden Number): Forbidden number 'one' (value: 1) was found ('One held a mere seven gems'). Rule 4 in the Generator's Guide lists it as forbidden.    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous number 'one' (value: 1) was found. It is not justified by Rule 1.A or a valid Rule 3 use (as it is forbidden by Rule 4), and violates Rule 5.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. Remove the phrase 'One held a mere seven gems,' and rephrase to introduce the group of seven without using the forbidden word 'One'. For example: 'A small cluster held seven gems...'    2. Remove the phrase ', the one with the sixteen gems' from the sentence 'He pointed towards the vein near the edge, the one with the sixteen gems.' The group of sixteen is already introduced as an input; identifying it again by number when pointing to the result violates Rule 2 and causes the Rule 1.A over-count. Simply pointing to 'the vein near the edge' is sufficient before naming it 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"Evaluation failed due to multiple violations of the ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES:\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'sixteen' (value: 16) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove.

This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'sixteen' (16)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound stillness held them captive.

It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.'

This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound stillness held them captive.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.

This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.

If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a.

The air, thick with ancient power, hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the very core of their being. Lyra felt the chaotic whispers that had plagued her mind fade entirely, replaced by a simple, unwavering truth that shone brighter than any light. Kaelen remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent witness to the unveiled secret. The stone around them seemed to breathe with the same slow, steady rhythm, the light painting long, dancing shadows across the floor. A sense of timelessness settled over the space, leaving only the breathtaking revelation before them.\n\nScattered across the central pedestal, and visible in shimmering veins within the chamber walls, were clusters of Sky-gems, each pulsing with its own distinct light and frequency. They saw a small collection radiating the deep indigo of twilight, numbering seven. Nearby lay a larger cluster, thirteen gems glowing with the pale silver of a rising moon. Deeper within the stone, a vein held sixteen gems, their light a steady, unwavering gold. Across the floor, a significant cache pulsed with the vibrant green of new leaves, twenty-seven in total. High on a ledge, nestled in a crystalline alcove, were twenty-eight gems, shimmering like captured starlight. Finally, a truly massive formation dominated one corner, thirty gems burning with the fierce red of a setting sun. Lyra reached out, her hand hovering over the pedestal, sensing the presence of these distinct groups, feeling their individual energies resonate alongside the memory of The Sky-Gem's True Pulse. As she focused, the disparate lights seemed to align, revealing a singular point of balance among them all. Her gaze settled back upon the vein holding the sixteen golden gems.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound stillness held them captive.

The air, thick with ancient power, hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the very core of their being. Lyra felt the chaotic whispers that had plagued her mind fade entirely, replaced by a simple, unwavering truth that shone brighter than any light. Kaelen remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent witness to the unveiled secret. The stone around them seemed to breathe with the same slow, steady rhythm, the light painting long, dancing shadows across the floor. A sense of timelessness settled over the space, leaving only the breathtaking revelation before them.\n\nScattered across the central pedestal, and visible in shimmering veins within the chamber walls, were clusters of Sky-gems, each pulsing with its own distinct light and frequency. They saw a small collection radiating the deep indigo of twilight, numbering seven. Nearby lay a larger cluster, thirteen gems glowing with the pale silver of a rising moon. Deeper within the stone, a vein held sixteen gems, their light a steady, unwavering gold. Across the floor, a significant cache pulsed with the vibrant green of new leaves, twenty-seven in total. High on a ledge, nestled in a crystalline alcove, were twenty-eight gems, shimmering like captured starlight. Finally, a truly massive formation dominated one corner, thirty gems burning with the fierce red of a setting sun. Lyra reached out, her hand hovering over the pedestal, sensing the presence of these distinct groups, feeling their individual energies resonate alongside the memory of The Sky-Gem's True Pulse. As she focused, the disparate lights seemed to align, revealing a singular point of balance among them all. Her gaze settled back upon the vein holding the sixteen golden gems. This particular cluster, she realized, stood as the perfect midpoint, the stable core around which all the others seemed to orbit in energetic harmony. This, she knew, was The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2 (Explicit Result), Rule 4 (Forbidden Number). Focus on: ensuring 'sixteen' appears exactly once as an input, ensuring the result is implied without re-stating 'sixteen', and removing the forbidden number 'one' (implied by 'singular').\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'sixteen' (value: 16) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'sixteen' (value: 16) was explicitly stated again when identifying the outcome ('The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') (...the sixteen golden gems. This particular cluster... This, she knew, was The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.). Rule 2 requires the result to be implied conceptually via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' without re-stating the number in that context.    - VIOLATION Rule 4 (Forbidden Number): Forbidden number 'one' (value: 1) was found, implied by the word singular. Rule 4 in the Generator's Guide lists it as forbidden.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the Rule 1.A frequency and Rule 2 violation for 'sixteen', remove the second mention of \"sixteen\" in the sentence identifying the outcome. Rephrase the sentence to refer to the group conceptually, e.g., \"Her gaze settled back upon that vein of golden gems.\"    2. To fix the Rule 4 violation, remove the word \"singular\".\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The generated beat text violates multiple rules from the ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Generator's Writing Guide).\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'sixteen' (value: 16) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'sixteen' (16)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a.

The air, thick with ancient power, hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the very core of their being. Lyra felt the chaotic whispers that had plagued her mind fade entirely, replaced by a simple, unwavering truth that shone brighter than any light. Kaelen remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent witness to the unveiled secret. The stone around them seemed to breathe with the same slow, steady rhythm, the light painting long, dancing shadows across the floor. A sense of timelessness settled over the space, leaving only the breathtaking revelation before them.\n\nScattered across the central pedestal, and visible in shimmering veins within the chamber walls, were clusters of Sky-gems, each pulsing with its own distinct light and frequency. They saw a small collection radiating the deep indigo of twilight, numbering seven. Nearby lay a larger cluster, thirteen gems glowing with the pale silver of a rising moon. Deeper within the stone, a vein held sixteen gems, their light a steady, unwavering gold. Across the floor, a significant cache pulsed with the vibrant green of new leaves, twenty-seven in total. High on a ledge, nestled in a crystalline alcove, were twenty-eight gems, shimmering like captured starlight. Finally, a truly massive formation dominated one corner, thirty gems burning with the fierce red of a setting sun. Lyra reached out, her hand hovering over the pedestal, sensing the presence of these distinct groups, feeling their individual energies resonate alongside the memory of The Sky-Gem's True Pulse. As she focused, the disparate lights seemed to align, revealing a point of balance among them all. Her gaze settled back upon that vein of golden gems. This particular cluster, she realized, stood as the perfect midpoint, the stable core around which all the others seemed to orbit in energetic harmony.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement?

Lyra followed his gaze, seeing the same phenomenon – pockets of intensified glow, each pulsing with a distinct frequency.\n\n\"Look,\" Kaelen murmured, his voice low. \"They gather... drawn by the chamber's heart.\"\n\nHe pointed to a cluster near the far wall, where the light seemed faintest, yet undeniably present. \"There are seven. A small, hesitant group.\" His finger moved to another spot, closer, where the glow was more vibrant. \"And here, thirteen. Stronger, more focused.\"\n\nMoving deeper into the space, they found another concentration, its light steady and clear. \"This cluster holds sixteen,\" Lyra noted, a sense of recognition in her tone, though it wasn't the same resonance as The Sky-Gem's True Pulse.\n\nFurther exploration revealed more. In a recess, the light pooled around twenty-seven gems, their combined energy creating a soft hum. Near the central altar, a larger, more chaotic gathering pulsed with the energy of twenty-eight. Finally, closest to the chamber's core, they found the largest concentration, thirty gems radiating a powerful, almost overwhelming light.\n\nThey stood amidst these distinct gatherings, the air thick with their varied frequencies.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'sixteen' (16)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

Kaelen stirred first, his eyes tracing the patterns of light across the floor, patterns that seemed to shift and coalesce around specific concentrations of the ambient energy. Lyra followed his gaze, seeing the same phenomenon – pockets of intensified glow, each pulsing with a distinct frequency.\n\n\"Look,\" Kaelen murmured, his voice low. \"They gather... drawn by the chamber's heart.\"\n\nHe pointed to a cluster near the far wall, where the light seemed faintest, yet undeniably present. \"There are seven. A small, hesitant group.\" His finger moved to another spot, closer, where the glow was more vibrant. \"And here, thirteen. Stronger, more focused.\"\n\nMoving deeper into the space, they found another concentration, its light steady and clear. \"This cluster holds sixteen,\" Lyra noted, a sense of recognition in her tone, though it wasn't the same resonance as The Sky-Gem's True Pulse.\n\nFurther exploration revealed more. In a recess, the light pooled around twenty-seven gems, their combined energy creating a soft hum. Near the central altar, a larger, more chaotic gathering pulsed with the energy of twenty-eight. Finally, closest to the chamber's core, they found the largest concentration, thirty gems radiating a powerful, almost overwhelming light.\n\nThey stood amidst these distinct gatherings, the air thick with their varied frequencies. Seven, thirteen, sixteen, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, thirty. Each group represented a different facet of the chamber's power, laid bare before them.\n\n\"They arrange themselves,\" Lyra whispered, \"not by size, but by some unseen order.\" She walked slowly, observing the relative positions of the clusters, the interplay of their lights. The group of sixteen seemed to occupy a unique position, a point of quiet balance amidst the others. It wasn't the most numerous, nor the least, but its presence felt like an anchor, a still point around which the other energies orbited.\n\nKaelen nodded, understanding dawning in his eyes. \"The fulcrum,\" he said, his voice filled with awe. \"This point of equilibrium. This is where the forces balance.\"\n\nLyra reached out a hand towards the cluster of sixteen, feeling the steady thrum of its energy. It was here, in this specific concentration, that the chamber's power found its stability. This was the heart of the revelation, the point of perfect poise.

Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound stillness held them captive. The air, thick with ancient power, hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the very core of their being. Lyra felt the chaotic whispers that had plagued her mind fade entirely, replaced by a simple, unwavering truth that shone brighter than any light. Kaelen remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent witness to the unveiled secret. The stone around them seemed to breathe with the same slow, steady rhythm, the light painting long, dancing shadows across the floor. A sense of timelessness settled over the space, leaving only the breathtaking revelation before them....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly.

This revision MUST meticulously address all issues identified by the validator below, while also re-adhering to ALL original rules for this scene. Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**\n```text\nThe breathtaking revelation held them, the silent song of the chamber now a tangible presence. Kaelen stirred first, his eyes tracing the patterns of light across the floor, patterns that seemed to shift and coalesce around specific concentrations of the ambient energy. Lyra followed his gaze, seeing the same phenomenon – pockets of intensified glow, each pulsing with a distinct frequency.\n\n\"Look,\" Kaelen murmured, his voice low. \"They gather... drawn by the chamber's heart.\"\n\nHe pointed to a cluster near the far wall, where the light seemed faintest, yet undeniably present. \"There are seven. A small, hesitant group.\" His finger moved to another spot, closer, where the glow was more vibrant. \"And here, thirteen. Stronger, more focused.\"\n\nMoving deeper into the space, they found another concentration, its light steady and clear. \"This cluster holds sixteen,\" Lyra noted, a sense of recognition in her tone, though it wasn't the same resonance as The Sky-Gem's True Pulse.\n\nFurther exploration revealed more. In a recess, the light pooled around twenty-seven gems, their combined energy creating a soft hum. Near the central altar, a larger, more chaotic gathering pulsed with the energy of twenty-eight. Finally, closest to the chamber's core, they found the largest concentration, thirty gems radiating a powerful, almost overwhelming light.\n\nThey stood amidst these distinct gatherings, the air thick with their varied frequencies. Seven, thirteen, sixteen, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, thirty. Each group represented a different facet of the chamber's power, laid bare before them.\n\n\"They arrange themselves,\" Lyra whispered, \"not by size, but by some unseen order.\" She walked slowly, observing the relative positions of the clusters, the interplay of their lights. The group of sixteen seemed to occupy a unique position, a point of quiet balance amidst the others. It wasn't the most numerous, nor the least, but its presence felt like an anchor, a still point around which the other energies orbited.\n\nKaelen nodded, understanding dawning in his eyes. \"The fulcrum,\" he said, his voice filled with awe. \"This point of equilibrium. This is where the forces balance.\"\n\nLyra reached out a hand towards the cluster of sixteen, feeling the steady thrum of its energy. It was here, in this specific concentration, that the chamber's power found its stability. This was the heart of the revelation, the point of perfect poise. This, they knew, was The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 1.B (Re-listing).

Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they h...\n```\n", "generator_output": "The breathtaking revelation held them, the silent song of the chamber now a tangible presence.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'sixteen' (16)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'two' (2), 'twenty' (20), 'twelve' (12), 'eleven' (11); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Sky-gems' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'two' (2), 'twenty' (20), 'twelve' (12), 'eleven' (11) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Core' (representing the value 'one'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one' (1) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty' (20): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twelve' (12) and 'twenty' (20). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The passage twisted and turned, the rough-hewn walls pressing closer still.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'two' (2), 'twenty' (20), 'twelve' (12), 'eleven' (11); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'.

Kaelen moved like a wraith beside her, his presence a silent anchor in the growing press of the mountain's embrace. The weight of the stone above felt immense, a tangible pressure urging them onward into the unknown depths.\n\nThey rounded a bend and found a small fissure weeping with moisture. Nestled within a pocket of dark rock were **two** Sky-gems, their faint light struggling against the gloom. Kaelen carefully extracted them, placing them in a padded pouch. Further on, the tunnel opened slightly into a damp grotto where phosphorescent moss clung to the walls. Here, scattered across a ledge, lay **eleven** more Sky-gems, pulsing with a soft, steady rhythm. Lyra gathered these with practiced hands. The passage narrowed again, forcing them single file past a section where the rock seemed to shimmer. Embedded in a crystalline vein were **twelve** Sky-gems, their facets catching the pendant's light and scattering it in tiny rainbows. Kaelen used a small, intricate tool to gently pry them free. Finally, the tunnel terminated in a small, circular chamber. In the center, resting on a natural stone pedestal, was a cluster of **twenty** Sky-gems, larger and more vibrant than the others they had found.\n\nThey brought these newly discovered gems together with the collection known as The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum. As the various quantities were placed side by side, a low thrumming filled the chamber. The combined light of the gems intensified dramatically, not just brighter, but focused. A device Kaelen carried, designed to measure the unique resonance of the Sky-gems, flared to life. Instead of a complex waveform or a fluctuating reading, it displayed a single, unwavering symbol, pure and resonant, representing the fundamental essence now coalesced from the gathered power.", "validator_system_prompt": "You are an AI numerical compliance checker and literary critic.\nYour ONLY task is to evaluate a story 'beat' against a provided set of ULTRA-STRICT numerical and storytelling rules.\nYou MUST output your response as a single, valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE, adhering precisely to the provided schema.\nDo not include any text, explanations, or markdown (like ```json) before the opening '{' or after the closing '}'.\nYour analysis must be meticulous, focusing on exact numerical frequencies and adherence to all specified constraints.\n", "validator_user_prompt": "You are an AI numerical compliance checker.

Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty' (20): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twelve' (12) and 'twenty' (20). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one' (1)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (5).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'two' (2), 'twenty' (20), 'twelve' (12), 'eleven' (11); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Sky-gems' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'two' (2), 'twenty' (20), 'twelve' (12), 'eleven' (11) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Core' (representing the value 'one'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one' (1) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twelve' (12) and 'twenty' (20). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The passage twisted and turned, the rough-hewn walls pressing closer still.

The air grew colder, carrying a damp chill that seeped into their bones, thick with the scent of subterranean water and ancient stone. Lyra's pendant cast a wavering pool of light, illuminating only a short distance ahead, leaving the rest of the tunnel swallowed by impenetrable shadow. The silence deepened, a heavy blanket broken only by the rhythmic drip of unseen water and the soft scuff of their boots on the uneven floor. Kaelen moved like a wraith beside her, his presence a silent anchor in the growing press of the mountain's embrace. The weight of the stone above felt immense, a tangible pressure urging them onward into the unknown depths.\n\nThey rounded a bend and found a small fissure weeping with moisture. Nestled within a pocket of dark rock were **two** Sky-gems, their faint light struggling against the gloom. Kaelen carefully extracted them, placing them in a padded pouch. Further on, the tunnel opened slightly into a damp grotto where phosphorescent moss clung to the walls. Here, scattered across a ledge, lay **eleven** more Sky-gems, pulsing with a soft, steady rhythm. Lyra gathered these with practiced hands. The passage narrowed again, forcing them single file past a section where the rock seemed to shimmer. Embedded in a crystalline vein were **twelve** Sky-gems, their facets catching the pendant's light and scattering it in tiny rainbows. Kaelen used a small, intricate tool to gently pry them free. Finally, the tunnel terminated in a small, circular chamber. In the center, resting on a natural stone pedestal, was a cluster of **twenty** Sky-gems, larger and more vibrant than the others they had found.\n\nThey brought these newly discovered gems together with the collection known as The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum. As the various quantities were placed side by side, a low thrumming filled the chamber. The combined light of the gems intensified dramatically, not just brighter, but focused. A device Kaelen carried, designed to measure the unique resonance of the Sky-gems, flared to life. Instead of a complex waveform or a fluctuating reading, it displayed a single, unwavering symbol, pure and resonant, representing the fundamental essence now coalesced from the gathered power.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 2 (Explicit Result), Rule 4 (Forbidden Number). Focus on: ensuring the result 'one' is implicit and removing all uses of the forbidden number 'one' (as 'single').\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 4 (Forbidden Number): Forbidden number 'one' (value: 1) was found, used as the word 'single' in the phrase 'single, unwavering symbol'. Rule 4 in the Generator's Guide lists it as forbidden.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'one' (value: 1) was explicitly stated using the word 'single' ('single, unwavering symbol') but should be implicit via 'The Sky-gem's Core'. This also violates Rule 4 as 'one' is forbidden.    - VIOLATION Rule 4 (Forbidden Number): Forbidden number 'one' (value: 1) was found, used as the word 'single' in the phrase 'single file'. Rule 4 in the Generator's Guide lists it as forbidden. Rule 3 does not permit using a number that is forbidden by Rule 4.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. Remove the phrase 'single, unwavering symbol' and rephrase to describe the symbol or reading without using the word 'single' or 'one'.    2. Remove the phrase 'single file' and rephrase the description of movement, perhaps using 'one by one' or similar non-numerical phrasing if essential, or simply stating they moved through the narrow passage.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"VIOLATION Rule 4 (Forbidden Number): Forbidden number 'one' (value: 1) was found, used as the word 'single' in the phrase 'single, unwavering symbol'.

For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one' (1)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (5).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met. False otherwise.\n\n-   **`explanation_for_generator` (string):**\n    *   If invalid, provide a DETAILED, step-by-step explanation of ALL violations found.

The air grew colder, carrying a damp chill that seeped into their bones, thick with the scent of subterranean water and ancient stone. Lyra's pendant cast a wavering pool of light, illuminating only a short distance ahead, leaving the rest of the tunnel swallowed by impenetrable shadow. The silence deepened, a heavy blanket broken only by the rhythmic drip of unseen water and the soft scuff of their boots on the uneven floor. Kaelen moved like a wraith beside her, his presence a silent anchor in the growing press of the mountain's embrace. The weight of the stone above felt immense, a tangible pressure urging them onward into the unknown depths.\n\nThey rounded a bend and found a small fissure weeping with moisture. Nestled within a pocket of dark rock were **two** Sky-gems, their faint light struggling against the gloom. Kaelen carefully extracted them, placing them in a padded pouch. Further on, the tunnel opened slightly into a damp grotto where phosphorescent moss clung to the walls. Here, scattered across a ledge, lay **eleven** more Sky-gems, pulsing with a soft, steady rhythm. Lyra gathered these with practiced hands. The passage narrowed again, forcing them to move carefully through a section where the rock seemed to shimmer. Embedded in a crystalline vein were **twelve** Sky-gems, their facets catching the pendant's light and scattering it in tiny rainbows. Kaelen used a small, intricate tool to gently pry them free. Finally, the tunnel terminated in a small, circular chamber. In the center, resting on a natural stone pedestal, was a cluster of **twenty** Sky-gems, larger and more vibrant than the others they had found.\n\nThey brought these newly discovered gems together with the collection known as The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum. As the various quantities were placed side by side, a low thrumming filled the chamber. The combined light of the gems intensified dramatically, not just brighter, but focused. A device Kaelen carried, designed to measure the unique resonance of the Sky-gems, flared to life. Instead of a complex waveform or a fluctuating reading, it displayed a pure, fundamental symbol, representing the core essence now coalesced from the gathered power.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'nineteen' (19), 'two' (2), 'twelve' (12), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-four' (24), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-gem's Core'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('eighteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'nineteen' (19), 'two' (2), 'twelve' (12), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-four' (24) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Core' (which represents the median value 'eighteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'eighteen' (18) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('eighteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'eighteen' (18) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' and NOT restate 'eighteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'twelve' (12) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'nineteen' (19) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('eighteen' (18)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'eighteen' (18) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eighteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eighteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eighteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eighteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Core', you MUST NOT use the word 'eighteen' or the digit '18' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eighteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Core') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eighteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Core.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Core represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eighteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.'

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'nineteen' (19), 'two' (2), 'twelve' (12), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-four' (24), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-gem's Core'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('eighteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'nineteen' (19), 'two' (2), 'twelve' (12), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-four' (24) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Core' (which represents the median value 'eighteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'eighteen' (18) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('eighteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'eighteen' (18) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' and NOT restate 'eighteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'twelve' (12) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'nineteen' (19) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('eighteen' (18)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'eighteen' (18) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eighteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eighteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eighteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eighteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Core', you MUST NOT use the word 'eighteen' or the digit '18' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eighteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Core') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eighteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Core.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Core represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eighteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A?

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'twelve' (12) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'nineteen' (19) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('eighteen' (18)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'eighteen' (18) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eighteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eighteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eighteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eighteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Core', you MUST NOT use the word 'eighteen' or the digit '18' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eighteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Core') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eighteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Core.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Core represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eighteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'eighteen' (18)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-gem's Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Luminous moss illuminated veins of shimmering ore embedded in the walls, but it was the scattered clusters of Sky-gems that drew their eyes. Near a pool of still water, they found a small cluster of **two** perfectly formed gems pulsing with soft light. Further along a narrow passage, a larger cache revealed **twelve** more, nestled in a crystalline hollow. Around a bend, they stumbled upon a significant deposit, a radiant hoard of **eighteen** gems that seemed to glow with an inner fire. Across the vast space, near a towering stalagmite, they located a cache holding **nineteen** gems, their light a vibrant blue.

This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'twelve' (12) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'nineteen' (19) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('eighteen' (18)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'eighteen' (18) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eighteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eighteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eighteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eighteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Core', you MUST NOT use the word 'eighteen' or the digit '18' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eighteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Core') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eighteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Core.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Core represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eighteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The shimmering veil parted, not with a rush of air, but a gentle dissolution. They stepped through into a silence that felt deeper than any they had known. The vibrant light of the passage faded behind them, leaving them in a vast, echoing space where shadows danced like ancient spirits. Strange, luminous moss clung to towering rock formations, casting an ethereal glow that painted the cavern walls in shifting shades of violet and silver. The air here was still and cool, carrying a faint, sweet scent like rain on stone. A low, resonant hum vibrated through the ground, a pulse that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the earth beneath their feet.

This revision MUST meticulously address all issues identified by the validator below, while also re-adhering to ALL original rules for this scene. Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**\n```text\nThe low hum intensified as they moved deeper into the cavern. Luminous moss illuminated veins of shimmering ore embedded in the walls, but it was the scattered clusters of Sky-gems that drew their eyes. Near a pool of still water, they found a small cluster of **two** perfectly formed gems pulsing with soft light. Further along a narrow passage, a larger cache revealed **twelve** more, nestled in a crystalline hollow. Around a bend, they stumbled upon a significant deposit, a radiant hoard of **eighteen** gems that seemed to glow with an inner fire. Across the vast space, near a towering stalagmite, they located a cache holding **nineteen** gems, their light a vibrant blue. Not far from there, tucked beneath an overhang, another cache held **nineteen** more, mirroring the blue intensity of the first. Finally, in the heart of the chamber, a vast vein contained **twenty-four** gems, the largest collection yet, their combined brilliance almost overwhelming.\n\nLyra and Kaelen surveyed their findings, the varied sizes and intensities of the Sky-gems creating a complex tapestry of light across the cavern floor. They gathered the distinct groups, arranging them, seeking a pattern, a center point amidst the disparate quantities. Their gaze settled on the deposit of **eighteen**. It seemed to anchor the entire collection, a point of perfect equilibrium around which the others naturally fell into place.

Focus on: exact counts for required inputs, ensuring result is implicit.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'eighteen' (value: 18) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'eighteen' (value: 18) was explicitly stated when identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Core'. Rule 2 requires the result to be implied, not stated numerically, even when the result is also a required input.    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous number 'eighteen' (value: 18) was found. It is not justified by Rule 1.A (as the required count for 'eighteen' as an input is 1, already met by the first mention) or a valid Rule 3 use, and violates Rule 2 by explicitly stating the result.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the count for 'eighteen' and ensure the result is implicit, remove the second mention of 'eighteen'. The sentence \"Their gaze settled on the deposit of eighteen.\" should be rephrased to refer to the group conceptually without using the number word 'eighteen'. For example, \"Their gaze settled on this significant deposit.\" or \"Their gaze settled on this particular group.\"\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'eighteen' (value: 18) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'twelve' (12) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'nineteen' (19) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('eighteen' (18)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'eighteen' (18) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eighteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eighteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eighteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eighteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Core', you MUST NOT use the word 'eighteen' or the digit '18' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eighteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Core') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eighteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Core.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Core represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eighteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'eighteen' (18)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-gem's Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Luminous moss illuminated veins of shimmering ore embedded in the walls, but it was the scattered clusters of Sky-gems that drew their eyes. Near a pool of still water, they found a small cluster of **two** perfectly formed gems pulsing with soft light. Further along a narrow passage, a larger cache revealed **twelve** more, nestled in a crystalline hollow. Around a bend, they stumbled upon a significant deposit, a radiant hoard of **eighteen** gems that seemed to glow with an inner fire. Across the vast space, near a towering stalagmite, they located a cache holding **nineteen** gems, their light a vibrant blue. Not far from there, tucked beneath an overhang, another cache held **nineteen** more, mirroring the blue intensity of the first. Finally, in the heart of the chamber, a vast vein contained **twenty-four** gems, the largest collection yet, their combined brilliance almost overwhelming.\n\nLyra and Kaelen surveyed their findings, the varied sizes and intensities of the Sky-gems creating a complex tapestry of light across the cavern floor. They gathered the distinct groups, arranging them, seeking a pattern, a center point amidst the disparate quantities. Their gaze settled on this significant deposit. It seemed to anchor the entire collection, a point of perfect equilibrium around which the others naturally fell into place. This group, they realized, felt like the very heart of the mountain's energy, the true 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as 'The Sky-Gem's Core'). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Mist-Pearl'. Its precise numerical value ('one') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one' (1) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Mist-Pearl' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('one') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'one' (1) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' and NOT restate 'one' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound silence of the gem-lit cavern settled around them, a heavy blanket woven with the faint, resonant hum of the stones.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as 'The Sky-Gem's Core'). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Mist-Pearl'. Its precise numerical value ('one') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one' (1) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Mist-Pearl' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('one') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'one' (1) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' and NOT restate 'one' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'one' (1): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'one' (1) and 'five' (5) and 'seven' (7) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twenty-four' (24) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('one') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'one' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'one Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'one' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Mist-Pearl', you MUST NOT use the word 'one' or the digit '1' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'one Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Mist-Pearl') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'one', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Mist-Pearl.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Mist-Pearl represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'one' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound silence of the gem-lit cavern settled around them, a heavy blanket woven with the faint, resonant hum of the stones.

The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved a single, perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the solitary pulse of the gem Lyra had found first.

SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'one' (1): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'one' (1) and 'five' (5) and 'seven' (7) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twenty-four' (24) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('one') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'one' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'one Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'one' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Mist-Pearl', you MUST NOT use the word 'one' or the digit '1' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'one Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Mist-Pearl') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'one', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Mist-Pearl.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Mist-Pearl represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'one' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one' (1)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-Gem's Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved a single, perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the solitary pulse of the gem Lyra had found first. Its quiet glow, standing apart from the others, felt distinct, holding a unique potential. This single, isolated heart of light, the least among the many, they knew, would be their next focus.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as 'The Sky-Gem's Core'). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Mist-Pearl'. Its precise numerical value ('one') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one' (1) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Mist-Pearl' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('one') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'one' (1) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' and NOT restate 'one' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'one' (1): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation.

Specifically, 'one' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'one Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'one' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Mist-Pearl', you MUST NOT use the word 'one' or the digit '1' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'one Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Mist-Pearl') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'one', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Mist-Pearl.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Mist-Pearl represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'one' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound silence of the gem-lit cavern settled around them, a heavy blanket woven with the faint, resonant hum of the stones. The air, previously still, seemed to hold its breath. Lyra traced the cool, damp rock face with her fingers, feeling the ancient weight of the earth. Kaelen remained a silent sentinel beside her, his gaze sweeping the dark openings that beckoned from the cavern's perimeter. Each passage was a mouth of deeper shadow, swallowing the vibrant light of the gems before it could penetrate far within.

This revision MUST meticulously address all issues identified by the validator below, while also re-adhering to ALL original rules for this scene. Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**\n```text\nLyra and Kaelen stepped from the central brilliance into the first shadowed passage. The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved a single, perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the solitary pulse of the gem Lyra had found first. Its quiet glow, standing apart from the others, felt distinct, holding a unique potential. This single, isolated heart of light, the least among the many, they knew, would be their next focus. They designated it 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2, Rule 5. Focus on: ensuring the exact count for the 'one' input is met (1 time) and that the operation's result ('one') is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl' without using the number word 'one' or 'single' when identifying the result.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'one' (value: 1) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'one' (value: 1) was explicitly stated using the word single when identifying 'The Mist-Pearl' (This single, isolated heart... They designated it 'The Mist-Pearl'). The result should be implied without using the number word.    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): The second mention of single (meaning one) is not justified by Rule 1.A (as it is not a distinct input count) or a valid Rule 3 use, making it an extraneous number.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the count for 'one' and ensure the result is implicit, remove the word \"single\" from the sentence identifying 'The Mist-Pearl'. Rephrase \"This single, isolated heart of light...\" to something like \"This isolated heart of light...\" or \"The gem Lyra had found first...\". This ensures 'one' is mentioned only once as an input and the result is implied.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The generated beat text violates multiple rules regarding numerical frequency and the handling of the operation's result.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'one' (value: 1) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'one' (1) and 'five' (5) and 'seven' (7) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twenty-four' (24) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('one') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'one' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'one Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'one' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Mist-Pearl', you MUST NOT use the word 'one' or the digit '1' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'one Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Mist-Pearl') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'one', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Mist-Pearl.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Mist-Pearl represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'one' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one' (1)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-Gem's Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved one perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the gem Lyra had found first. Its quiet glow, standing apart from the others, felt distinct, holding a unique potential. This isolated heart of light, the least among the many, they knew, would be their next focus.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as 'The Sky-Gem's Core'). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Mist-Pearl'. Its precise numerical value ('one') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one' (1) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Mist-Pearl' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('one') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'one' (1) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' and NOT restate 'one' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'one' (1): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'one' (1) and 'five' (5) and 'seven' (7) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twenty-four' (24) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('one') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'one' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'one Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'one' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Mist-Pearl', you MUST NOT use the word 'one' or the digit '1' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'one Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Mist-Pearl') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'one', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Mist-Pearl.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Mist-Pearl represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'one' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4.

The air, previously still, seemed to hold its breath. Lyra traced the cool, damp rock face with her fingers, feeling the ancient weight of the earth. Kaelen remained a silent sentinel beside her, his gaze sweeping the dark openings that beckoned from the cavern's perimeter. Each passage was a mouth of deeper shadow, swallowing the vibrant light of the gems before it could penetrate far within. They stood together, poised at the edge of the brilliance, contemplating the unknown paths that lay ahead, the quiet decision forming between them without need for spoken words....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly.

The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved one perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the gem Lyra had found first. Its quiet glow, standing apart from the others, felt distinct, holding a unique potential. This isolated heart of light, the least among the many, they knew, would be their next focus. They designated it 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 2):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2. Focus on: exact counts for required inputs, ensuring result is implicit.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'one' (value: 1) was required 1 time(s) but found 3 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'one' (value: 1) was explicitly identified by referring back to the gem Lyra had found first (which was the 'one' gem), but should be implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'. The narrative should imply which group is the smallest without explicitly naming the number 'one' or directly referencing the specific group that had 'one' item in the context of stating the result.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the Rule 1.A count for 'one', ensure it appears exactly 1 time as a distinct input. Currently, it appears 3 times due to re-mentioning the first gem when identifying the outcome.    2. To fix the Rule 2 violation, rephrase the section identifying 'The Mist-Pearl'. Avoid referring back to 'the gem Lyra had found first'. Instead, imply the outcome by describing its characteristic (e.g., 'the smallest collection', 'the least significant group') without using the number 'one' or explicitly linking it to the initial 'one' gem.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'one' (value: 1) was required 1 time(s) but found 3 time(s).

The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'one' (1) and 'five' (5) and 'seven' (7) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twenty-four' (24) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('one') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'one' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'one Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'one' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Mist-Pearl', you MUST NOT use the word 'one' or the digit '1' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'one Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Mist-Pearl') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'one', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Mist-Pearl.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Mist-Pearl represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'one' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one' (1)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-Gem's Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved one perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the least significant collection. Its quiet glow, standing apart from the others, felt distinct, holding a unique potential. This isolated heart of light, the least among the many, they knew, would be their next focus. They designated it 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Sky-gems'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-five' (25), 'three' (3), 'nine' (9)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Mist-Pearl') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-five' (25), 'three' (3), 'nine' (9) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-five').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-five' (25) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-five' (25) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' and NOT restate 'twenty-five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'three' (3): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-five' (25): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'three' (3) and 'nine' (9) and 'twenty-five' (25). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-five' (25) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-five' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-five' or the digit '25' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sovereign Sky-Gem.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sovereign Sky-Gem represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'twenty-five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'four' (4) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the four groups were examined').\n        *   **CRITICAL: No General Phrasing with 'one', 'two', or 'three':** For this specific scene, the numbers 'one', 'two', and 'three' are ALL either required by Rule 1.A (their use is dedicated to fulfilling those input counts) or are forbidden by Rule 4. Therefore, 'one', 'two', and 'three' CANNOT be used for any additional general narrative phrasing in this scene.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Mist-Pearl'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The descent continued, a slow, steady surrender to the mountain's embrace.

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'three' (3) and 'nine' (9) and 'twenty-five' (25). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-five' (25) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-five' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-five' or the digit '25' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sovereign Sky-Gem.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sovereign Sky-Gem represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'twenty-five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'four' (4) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the four groups were examined').\n        *   **CRITICAL: No General Phrasing with 'one', 'two', or 'three':** For this specific scene, the numbers 'one', 'two', and 'three' are ALL either required by Rule 1.A (their use is dedicated to fulfilling those input counts) or are forbidden by Rule 4. Therefore, 'one', 'two', and 'three' CANNOT be used for any additional general narrative phrasing in this scene.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Mist-Pearl'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The descent continued, a slow, steady surrender to the mountain's embrace. The air grew heavier, thick with the ancient quiet that permeated the stone. Lyra's hand remained against the wall, seeking comfort in the rough texture, feeling the deep, slow pulse of the earth itself. The pearl's glow offered scant reassurance, pushing back the absolute blackness only slightly. Kaelen moved like a part of the shadow, his presence a silent anchor in the oppressive dark. Each breath felt cold in their lungs, each sound they made seemed swallowed instantly by the profound stillness. They walked on, leaving the world of sun and sky far behind, sinking deeper into the mountain's heart....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly. Do not add titles, notes, or anything outside the story itself.", "generator_output": "They moved through the echoing silence, the pearl's light a small, fragile bubble against the vast dark. The air grew colder, carrying the scent of damp earth and something else, something mineral and sharp. Kaelen stopped, his hand raised. Against the rough stone wall, embedded in a shallow fissure, pulsed a cluster of faint blue light. Lyra knelt, her fingers tracing the cool surface of the first Sky-gems they had found in this depth. There were **three** such gems here, nestled together like tiny eggs.\n\nFurther along the passage, where a narrow vein of quartz cut through the rock, another discovery awaited. Here, the Sky-gems were smaller, like scattered seeds, but more numerous. Lyra counted them carefully in the dim light; there were **nine** in this scattered collection.\n\nThe tunnel opened into a small cavern, the air suddenly feeling vast and empty. And there, dominating the space from a pedestal of natural stone, lay a single, magnificent cluster. It wasn't just a few gems; it was a cascade of light, a breathtaking hoard. These Sky-gems were larger, more vibrant than any they had seen before, their combined glow pushing back the shadows with authority. Lyra felt a gasp catch in her throat as she took in the sheer quantity; there were **twenty-five** of these luminous treasures piled high.\n\nKaelen stepped closer, his eyes scanning the hoard, then glancing back towards the passage where they had found the smaller groups, and even further back in his mind, to the faint memory of The Mist-Pearl. The contrast was stark. The cluster on the pedestal pulsed with a power that dwarfed the others. It was clear, without question, that this last discovery was the most significant, the heart of the mountain's hoard. This was not just another collection of Sky-gems; this was the pinnacle, the ultimate expression of their quest.

Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'three' (3): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-five' (25): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'three' (3) and 'nine' (9) and 'twenty-five' (25). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-five' (25) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-five' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-five' or the digit '25' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sovereign Sky-Gem.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sovereign Sky-Gem represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'twenty-five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'four' (4) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the four groups were examined').\n        *   **CRITICAL: No General Phrasing with 'one', 'two', or 'three':** For this specific scene, the numbers 'one', 'two', and 'three' are ALL either required by Rule 1.A (their use is dedicated to fulfilling those input counts) or are forbidden by Rule 4. Therefore, 'one', 'two', and 'three' CANNOT be used for any additional general narrative phrasing in this scene.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Mist-Pearl'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-five' (25)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (4).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Mist-Pearl') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Sky-gems'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-five' (25), 'three' (3), 'nine' (9)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Mist-Pearl') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-five' (25), 'three' (3), 'nine' (9) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-five').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-five' (25) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-five' (25) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' and NOT restate 'twenty-five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'three' (3): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-five' (25): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'three' (3) and 'nine' (9) and 'twenty-five' (25). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-five' (25) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-five' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-five' or the digit '25' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sovereign Sky-Gem.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sovereign Sky-Gem represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'twenty-five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'four' (4) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the four groups were examined').\n        *   **CRITICAL: No General Phrasing with 'one', 'two', or 'three':** For this specific scene, the numbers 'one', 'two', and 'three' are ALL either required by Rule 1.A (their use is dedicated to fulfilling those input counts) or are forbidden by Rule 4. Therefore, 'one', 'two', and 'three' CANNOT be used for any additional general narrative phrasing in this scene.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Mist-Pearl'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The descent continued, a slow, steady surrender to the mountain's embrace.

Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'three' (3) and 'nine' (9) and 'twenty-five' (25). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-five' (25) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-five' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-five' or the digit '25' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sovereign Sky-Gem.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sovereign Sky-Gem represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'twenty-five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'four' (4) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the four groups were examined').\n        *   **CRITICAL: No General Phrasing with 'one', 'two', or 'three':** For this specific scene, the numbers 'one', 'two', and 'three' are ALL either required by Rule 1.A (their use is dedicated to fulfilling those input counts) or are forbidden by Rule 4. Therefore, 'one', 'two', and 'three' CANNOT be used for any additional general narrative phrasing in this scene.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Mist-Pearl'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-five' (25)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (4).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?
