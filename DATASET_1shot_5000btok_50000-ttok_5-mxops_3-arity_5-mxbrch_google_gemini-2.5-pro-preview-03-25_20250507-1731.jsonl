Inside, amidst cobweb-draped alembics and forgotten crucibles, they found not one, but five distinct collections of faintly glowing orbs – ectoplasmic resonators, humming with trapped spectral energy.\\n\\n\"Remarkable,\" Elara breathed, her lantern light dancing across the ethereal glow. \"Blackwood didn't specify which one.\"\\n\\nSilas moved from one cluster to the next, his brow furrowed in concentration. \"This first cache,\" he announced, pointing to a small crate, \"contains precisely 51 resonators.\" He moved to a larger, more haphazard pile. \"This one holds 62.\" He continued his count. \"Here we have 82. This alcove contains 83. And the final one, tucked away in this corroded vat, has 84.\"\\n\\nHe straightened, dusting his hands. \"Five caches in total. Blackwood's riddle spoke of a 'balanced resonance', a 'central harmony'. If we arrange these quantities in order – 51, 62, 82, 83, 84 – the median, the very middle value, is 82.\"\\n\\n\"The central harmony,\" Elara mused. \"It must be the cache with 82. That one.\" She indicated the third collection Silas had counted. \"Let us secure these.\"\n\nSilas nodded, his gaze fixed on the specified cache, the weight of their task settling heavily in the cool, still air of the vault. A subtle shift in her posture indicated a readiness to proceed, her earlier tension easing into focused resolve. The faint scent of old parchment and metal hung around them as they prepared to gather the selected items. Together, they turned towards their objective, a silent understanding passing between them.\n\nA hush fell over the immediate vicinity, the earlier sounds of preparation fading into an expectant silence. The air grew cooler, carrying the faint, metallic scent of something ancient and undisturbed. A subtle shift in their posture, a straightening of spines, indicated a readiness to confront whatever lay ahead. They moved as a unit, their focus unwavering.\n\nA palpable tension filled the corridor, the air thick with unspoken apprehension. Dust motes, disturbed by their careful passage, swirled in the faint light filtering from an unseen source ahead. A collective intake of breath, almost inaudible, signaled their shared anticipation as they rounded a bend. The path before them narrowed, forcing them into a tighter formation.\n\nSunlight, previously dappling through the leaves, now struggled to penetrate the dense canopy overhead, casting the way forward in a somber, greenish twilight. A palpable hush fell over the group, the only sounds their soft footfalls and the occasional rustle of unseen creatures in the undergrowth. Elara instinctively drew her cloak tighter, a shiver tracing its way down her spine despite the humid air. Liam’s jaw tightened, his gaze sweeping the encroaching shadows with a newfound wariness.\n\nThe air, already thick, grew heavier still, clinging to his skin like a damp shroud. A shiver, unrelated to any chill, traced its way down Liam’s spine as the silence stretched, taut and expectant. The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves filled his nostrils, a primal perfume of the untamed. Every flicker of movement at the edge of his vision was a phantom, yet his muscles remained coiled, ready.\n\nThe scent, rich and earthy, led him deeper into the shadowed undercroft. It was not the decay of ages, but something vibrant, almost alive. The phantoms at the edge of his vision resolved into shimmering motes of light as he and Elara rounded a crumbling buttress. Before them lay four distinct alcoves, each carved into the damp stone, pulsating with an ethereal glow.\\n\\n\"Ectoplasmic resonators,\" Elara breathed, her voice hushed with awe. \"And so many.\"\\n\\nAlistair approached cautiously. The first alcove emitted a soft, pearlescent light, revealing a cluster of 26 crystalline devices. The second, a little further, pulsed with a stronger, azure radiance; within it lay 32 resonators. A third, almost directly opposite, contained 33, their light a vibrant, almost agitated emerald. But it was the final, deepest alcove that drew their full attention. It blazed with an intense, white-gold luminescence, a veritable hoard of 97 ectoplasmic resonators, humming with contained power.\\n\\nAs Alistair reached for the nearest alcove, the one containing the 26, a faint shimmer of force repelled his hand. He tried the alcove with 32, then the one with 33, with the same result. Only the path to the largest cache remained open, a subtle invitation in the air.\\n\\nElara, meanwhile, had been studying a small, leather-bound journal – her notes on the elusive 'Resonator's Stillpoint'. \"The Stillpoint spoke of achieving a specific harmonic resonance, a delicate equilibrium,\" she murmured, looking up from her notes to the four caches. \"But this... this configuration is different. The ambient energies here seem to dictate a different principle. It's as if only the most potent source can be attuned to, or perhaps safely accessed.\" She pointed to a barely visible inscription above the largest alcove. \"It suggests only the fullest measure will respond.\"\\n\\nAlistair nodded, his gaze fixed on the blazing 97. \"So, of the 26, the 32, the 33, and these 97, our choice is not merely one of preference, but of necessity. The other paths are closed to us. We must secure the 97 resonators.\" He took a steadying breath, the primal perfume now almost overwhelming. \"Let us hope this 'fullest measure' is indeed what The Sovereign Resonance requires.\"\n\nA palpable hush fell over the assembled figures, the previous pronouncement hanging heavy in the air like a storm cloud. Shoulders sagged under invisible weights, and eyes, shadowed with a mixture of trepidation and weary resolve, darted towards the focal point of their hopes. The very air seemed to still, anticipating the universe's judgment. A collective, silent breath was held, awaiting the outcome.\n\nThe oppressive weight in the atmosphere seemed to lessen, just a fraction, as if the universe itself had exhaled. Around the gathered entities, a faint, almost imperceptible shimmer danced at the edge of vision, a subtle shift in the cosmic fabric. Eyes, wide and unblinking, remained fixed on the void, though a flicker of something new – hope, or perhaps a deeper fear – stirred within them. The silence stretched, but its quality changed, becoming less a void and more a canvas awaiting its first, momentous stroke.\n\nAn expectant stillness settled, heavy and profound, as if the cosmos itself paused in anticipation. Gazes, wide and luminous, fixed upon the altered void, reflecting the shimmering potential where mere emptiness had so recently dominated. A low, almost imperceptible hum started to resonate, a vibration felt deep within the chest, heralding imminent change. The atmosphere crackled with an unspoken promise, a sense of immense power about to be unleashed.\n\nA profound stillness descended, broken only by the sharp intake of collective breaths. Eyes, wide and reflecting an unseen luminescence, darted nervously, searching for the nexus of this burgeoning force. Shoulders hunched imperceptibly, a silent bracing against the imminent. The air itself grew heavy, pressing down with a tangible weight of expectation.\n\nA profound hush descended, swallowing the faintest whisper and leaving only the thumping of hearts as audible proof of life. Faces, pale in the gloom, turned upwards, their expressions a mixture of dread and a strange, undeniable curiosity. The very stones of the ancient hall seemed to hum with a nascent energy, a vibration felt more in the bones than heard with the ears. A subtle shift in the oppressive quality of the silence indicated the moment was drawing perilously near.\n\nThe very air seemed to curdle. Then, with a sigh like a dying breath, the oppressive silence fractured. Before them, in the ethereal gloom, two distinct alcoves shimmered into view, previously hidden by the shifting miasma. Each pulsed with a faint, internal luminescence.\\n\\nAlistair Finch, ever cautious, approached the first. Within, nestled on velvet that had long since rotted to dust, lay a collection of delicate, spiralling devices – ectoplasmic resonators. He counted them with a practiced eye. \"This one holds 26,\" he announced, his voice low.\\n\\nElara Vance moved to the second alcove. The glow here was stronger, the hum more pronounced. \"And this cache,\" she reported, after a moment of careful scrutiny, \"contains 87 resonators.\"\\n\\nThey stood back, the two small collections of arcane technology casting faint, dancing shadows. Elara broke the silence. \"The Sovereign Resonance… its nature was one of significant magnitude, a conceptual weight we must now balance against these tangible findings.\"\\n\\nAlistair nodded, his gaze fixed on the larger cache. \"Indeed. We have these two distinct quantities: 26 and 87. If the Sovereign Resonance represents the upper boundary, a value conceptually greater than either of these, and 26 the lower, then the path of equilibrium, the true Stillpoint, must be found at the median.\" He gestured towards the second alcove. \"Therefore, this collection of 87 resonators is the one we require. It is the fulcrum.\"\n\nThe final word, 'fulcrum,' seemed to solidify the very air within the cramped space. A profound stillness settled upon them, broken only by the faint, almost imperceptible hum emanating from the metallic array. Lyra’s breath caught, her eyes wide as she absorbed the pronouncement, while Torvin slowly ran a hand through his already disheveled hair, a silent testament to the weight of the discovery.\n\nThe silence that followed stretched, taut and brittle, like old parchment. Dust motes, previously unseen, danced in the singular shaft of light piercing the gloom, each a tiny world oblivious to the gravity settling upon the room's occupants. A low hum from unseen machinery outside was the only sound, a stark contrast to the turmoil brewing within. Someone finally shifted, the subtle creak of a floorboard an explosion in the stillness.\n\nThe sound, though small, sent a jolt through the waiting figures. Eyes, wide and unblinking in the dim light filtering from a distant streetlamp, darted towards the source. A collective breath was held, each person a statue carved from nervous anticipation. The air thickened, heavy with unspoken questions.\n\nA hush fell, so profound that the frantic thumping of a heart seemed to echo in the stillness. Shadows danced in the periphery, playing tricks on already strained eyes. Someone shifted their weight, the rustle of fabric a deafening intrusion in the oppressive quiet. The moment elongated, stretching towards an unseen precipice.\n\nA palpable tension filled the air, thick and cloying like summer humidity before a storm. Eyes darted, wide and searching the deepening shadows, every creak of the old floorboards amplifying the pervasive unease. Hearts pounded a frantic, irregular rhythm against ribs, a silent drumbeat in the otherwise suffocating stillness. Someone swallowed, the small, dry sound unnervingly loud in the charged quiet. The wait became almost unbearable, a physical weight pressing down.\n\nA faint, crystalline chime broke the oppressive silence, drawing their eyes to the far end of the vault. Alistair, ever the first to react to such subtle cues, moved towards a shadowed alcove. Within, nestled on a bed of faded silk, lay a single, exquisitely crafted ectoplasmic resonator, its surface shimmering with a nascent glow. \"Just 1 here,\" he announced, his voice a low rumble that barely disturbed the dust motes dancing in the lone shaft of gaslight.\\n\\nA moment later, Elara’s voice, sharp with discovery, cut through the gloom from the opposite side. \"And this coffer contains... 57 resonators, Alistair. All from the same crafting, by the feel of them.\" She gestured to an ornate, lead-lined box she had prised open.\\n\\nThey converged on the central dais, upon which rested the Aetheric Averaging Engine, its polished brass and intricate glass tubing gleaming faintly. The core crystal of the Engine already pulsed with a steady, contained luminescence – the resonance of The Ectoplasmic Stillpoint they had so painstakingly achieved.\\n\\nAlistair placed the lone resonator into one of the Engine's induction cups. Elara carefully transferred the larger collection of 57 into its counterpart. The combined energy of these two new caches, a total of 58 resonators, introduced a fresh, almost electric hum to the chamber.\\n\\nThe Engine whirred to life. Delicate mechanisms clicked, and a soft, blue light flowed from the core crystal, enveloping the two new inputs. The hum intensified, the glass tubes glowing brighter, before subsiding with a final, satisfying sigh. Within the Engine’s central crystallization chamber, a newly formed set of resonators lay, each one radiating a pure, unwavering light.\\n\\nElara leaned closer, her breath misting in the cool air. \"The calibration is perfect,\" she whispered, a note of triumph in her voice. \"It has yielded exactly 48.\"\n\nA wave of relief washed over her, loosening the tight knot of anxiety that had been coiling in her stomach. The soft glow of the interface illuminated her face, now etched with a profound sense of accomplishment rather than stress. Around them, the usually frantic energy of the lab seemed to pause, holding its breath in shared acknowledgement of the breakthrough. She finally allowed herself a deep, steadying breath, the scent of ozone and warm circuits filling her lungs.\n\nThe metallic tang lingered in the air, a familiar perfume accompanying the soft, rhythmic hum emanating from the nearby console. Her shoulders, previously rigid with anticipation, relaxed somewhat, a subtle easing of the immense pressure that had been building. Around her, the myriad lights of the control room blinked in steady, almost hypnotic patterns, reflecting in her slowly focusing eyes as her gaze drifted towards the main viewscreen.\n\nThe star-dusted void depicted there swam into a breathtaking panorama, a swirling nebula of impossible colours that seemed to breathe with a life of its own. A quiet reverence settled upon the bridge, the usual chatter and clatter conspicuously absent. Her own heart gave a little flutter, a mix of trepidation and wonder at the spectacle unfolding before them.\n\nThe very air around them seemed to crackle with an unseen energy, causing the fine hairs on their arms to prickle in response. A collective gasp rippled through the watchers, a shared intake of breath against the backdrop of the otherworldly sounds emanating from the display. Eyes, wide and reflecting the brilliant light, darted amongst the shifting patterns, trying to comprehend the impossible. They stood, for a long moment, simply transfixed by the breathtaking scene.\n\nA profound stillness descended, heavy and charged, as if the very air held its breath in reverence. Wide eyes, reflecting the impossible vista, blinked slowly, attempting to etch every impossible detail onto memory. Shoulders, moments before rigid with disbelief, began to soften, the initial shock giving way to a dawning, soul-deep awe. The mundane concerns of moments before simply evaporated, lost in the grandeur.\n\nThe awe, though immense, did not paralyze. It sharpened into a focused urgency. Within the vast, resonant chamber, their search began. Elara was first to cry out, her voice echoing slightly. \"Here! By the obsidian plinth!\" She indicated a recessed compartment, revealing a shimmering cluster of 62 ectoplasmic resonators. Across the echoing space, Blackwood’s gruff voice followed. \"And another cache here, nestled within the roots of this petrified ironwood. It holds 80.\"\\nThey carefully gathered the two new collections, their ghostly light pulsing in unison. These they brought to the central, intricately carved altar where the fruits of 'The Core Resonance' already lay, a faint thrumming in the air around it. As the last of the newly found resonators were added, the ambient thrum escalated into a sharp, keening whine. The combined energies on the altar blazed into an incandescent point of white light, impossibly bright, then violently contracted with a sound like tearing reality. A wave of pressure washed over them, and when their senses cleared, the altar was starkly empty. The conflagration had consumed all, leaving precisely 0 stable ectoplasmic resonators.\n\n---\n\n**Question:** Following the entire sequence of events described in the story, exactly how many ectoplasmic resonators did the characters end up with?

This feels like the old tales of Sky-King Aerion's hidden vaults, each guarded by a subtle trick,\" Elara murmured, her gaze sweeping across the cavernous chamber they'd stumbled into. Before them, set into alcoves carved from the living rock of the floating island, were five distinct crystalline containers, each humming with a faint, ethereal glow.\\n\\n\"Aetherium power-cores,\" Jax breathed, his optical monocle whirring as he scanned them. \"And quite a few. Look here.\" He pointed to the first. \"This one holds 28 cores.\" He moved to the next. \"This one, 37. And here... 52.\" His excitement grew. \"This one has 78!\" He finally reached the last, largest container. \"And this magnificent cache holds 86 cores!\"\\n\\nA low thrumming sound filled the air, and an intricate series of gears and levers on a central pedestal began to whir. A single, small hatch, barely large enough for one container to pass through, slowly opened on the pedestal. Above it, an inscription glowed faintly: \"Only the greatest offering shall pass the Warden's Gate.\"\\n\\n\"So,\" Captain Valerius stated, stroking his metallic beard, \"it seems we can only take one cache through, and the mechanism demands the largest. We have five options: 28, 37, 52, 78, and 86. The choice is clear. The Warden wants the most potent offering. We must select the cache with 86 power-cores.\"\\n\\nElara nodded. \"It's a test of discernment, perhaps. Or simply a greedy guardian. Either way, 86 it is.\" Jax was already moving towards the largest container, the one holding the 86 cores, the hum from its contents resonating with the pedestal's own energy.\n\nA palpable thrum filled the chamber, growing stronger with each passing moment. Those present watched, breath caught in their throats, as the light from the pedestal pulsed in time with the container's vibrations. The air grew thick with anticipation, every eye fixed on the unfolding spectacle. A sense of profound power emanated from the scene.\n\nThe very air grew heavy, thick with an unspoken tension that pressed upon every soul present. Breaths caught in throats, a collective hush falling as faces, previously animated, now held expressions of stark wonder or dawning fear. A few individuals shifted uneasily, their gaze unwavering, while a palpable hum seemed to resonate from the ground beneath their feet. The world outside this focal point faded, a distant murmur beyond the charged stillness.\n\nThe very air seemed to hum, a low thrum vibrating against their skin, tasting faintly of dust and something akin to old magic. Breaths were held, suspended in the quietude, each heartbeat a dull drum against ribs. Eyes, wide and reflecting the dim, ambient light, remained locked, searching for any tell, any flicker of intent. The quiet stretched, becoming a living entity in the space between them.\n\nThe silence itself seemed to breathe, expanding and contracting with an unseen rhythm, pressing down with a palpable weight. Dust motes, caught in the faint shafts of ambient light, performed a slow, silent ballet, oblivious to the taut energy coiling in the room. A muscle twitched beneath an eye, a minute betrayal of the otherwise stoic facade. The very air grew heavy, tasting of old paper and unspoken words.\n\nA hush fell, deeper than before, pressing down on them. Dust motes, previously unseen, danced in the slivers of light piercing the gloom. Someone cleared their throat, a small, dry sound that seemed to echo in the stillness. Eyes darted, then quickly looked away, unable to meet the intensity of the moment.\n\nThe silence stretched, taut and brittle, until Elara finally broke it, her voice raspy. \"Enough. We need power. The Resonant Sigil won't activate itself.\" She gestured towards a series of shadowed alcoves carved into the obsidian-like rock of the floating island, barely visible in the dim, ever-present twilight. \"Fan out. Look for any aetherium caches.\"\\n\\nThey split, their footsteps muffled by the strange, springy moss that carpeted the ground. It wasn't long before Jasper called out, his voice a hushed exclamation. \"Over here! Found one!\" He held up a small, humming container. Inside, nestled on faded velvet, were 10 gleaming aetherium power-cores. Soon after, Lyra’s voice echoed from another alcove, a touch more confident. \"Another! This one holds 17 cores.\" The search continued through the gloom, yielding two more finds: a larger cache with 43 cores discovered by Elara herself, its light surprisingly vibrant, and a final, well-hidden deposit containing 46 cores, unearthed by the team's grizzled engineer, Barnaby, from beneath a loose flagstone.\\n\\nThey gathered their haul, the four distinct groups of softly glowing crystals pooling their light. \"That's 116 new cores,\" Jasper announced, counting them carefully, a hint of triumph in his voice. \"A good find, this one.\"\\n\\nElara nodded, her gaze already fixed on the central chamber where the enigmatic device known as 'The Apex Aetherium' pulsed with a faint, internal light, its intricate gears momentarily still. \"Bring them. It’s time to see if we have enough.\"\\n\\nOne by one, they carefully placed the newly acquired 116 cores onto the designated crystalline receptacles surrounding The Apex Aetherium, adding them to the existing, potent energy source already integrated within the complex clockwork device. As the last core clicked into place, the entire apparatus shuddered violently. A blinding azure light flared from its core, engulfing all the assembled aetherium. The air crackled, heavy with ozone and an almost painful thrumming that resonated deep in their chests. Then, as suddenly as it began, the light subsided, the resonating hum fading to a mere whisper. On the receptacles, where moments before a significant collection of power-cores had rested, now lay only two, solitary aetherium cores, glowing with an almost incandescent purity. The rest had vanished, consumed in the brief, violent reaction, leaving behind only this precise, potent remnant.\n\nA palpable silence descended, thick with the ozone tang of spent energy. Kaelen’s eyes, wide and reflecting the faint luminescence of the remnant, darted towards Lyra, whose usually stern face was etched with a mixture of awe and trepidation. She took a slow, deliberate step closer, the crunch of debris under her boot the sole sound breaking the stillness. The air itself seemed to hum around the spot where the transformation had occurred.\n\nA faint, ethereal glow pulsed from the epicenter, casting long, dancing shadows that writhed across the ancient flagstones. The very stones beneath their feet seemed to thrum with a silent, potent resonance. Eyes wide, they exchanged uncertain glances, the unspoken question hanging heavy in the supercharged air. A subtle scent, like ozone and something far older, drifted on the currents.\n\nThe very air seemed to thicken, pressing in with an almost physical weight that stole breath. A collective nervousness rippled through those present, manifesting in tightened jaws and quick, furtive glances. The silence that followed the strange aroma was profound, heavy with unspoken questions.\n\nThe peculiar scent, a bizarre blend of over-ripe fruit and singed metal, lingered, making the air feel heavy and cloying. Across the room, a figure previously still as stone now subtly leaned forward, eyes narrowed in suspicion. Another companion, pale and wide-eyed, clutched at the heavy brocade of their sleeve, knuckles white. The stillness was broken only by the almost imperceptible creak of ancient floorboards settling.\n\nA shiver, cold and sharp, traced its way down someone's spine, unrelated to the room's ambient temperature. Breath hitched, caught somewhere in a throat, as eyes darted towards the darkest corners of the vast chamber. Dust motes, previously invisible, danced in the slivers of moonlight that pierced the grimy windows, like tiny, silent witnesses. The air itself felt heavy, pressing in with the weight of forgotten years.\n\nDust motes danced in the slivers of moonlight that pierced the grimy windows, like tiny, silent witnesses. The air itself felt heavy, pressing in with the weight of forgotten years. Captain Eva Rostova pushed aside a cobweb thick as rigging. \"Alright, Alistair, spread out. We're looking for concentrated aetherium signatures.\"\\n\\nThey moved through the derelict pumping station, their boots echoing on the corroded metal walkways. Alistair, his optical enhancers whirring softly, pointed towards a reinforced hatch. \"Eva, behind this. A distinct energy bloom.\" With a grunt, they heaved it open, revealing a small, shielded alcove. Inside, crystalline power-cores pulsed with a faint, blue light. \"I count 23 units here,\" Alistair announced, his voice tight. \"But the containment field… it’s fluctuating erratically. Unstable.\"\\n\\nEva frowned, her gaze sweeping the chamber. \"There's another signature, stronger, further in.\" She led the way to a second, more robustly built vault door. This one yielded with a pneumatic hiss, revealing a larger cache. The cores within, numbering exactly 54, glowed with a steady, inviting luminescence. The air around them felt charged, but stable.\\n\\n\"Two caches,\" Eva murmured, \"one holding 23, the other 54. The resonance from that smaller batch is too chaotic; attempting to extract them could be catastrophic. It seems only the greater quantity offers a stable retrieval path.\" She recalled the intricate patterns revealed by The Aetherium Resonant Sigil; it had always hinted at seeking the most potent, most harmonious concentrations of power, not scattered or volatile sources. \"The Sigil guided us towards a dominant harmonic. Between a dangerously unstable 23 and a robust 54, the path is clear. We take the 54.\"\n\nA collective sigh, a mixture of relief and trepidation, rippled through the assembled crew as the captain's decisive tone settled the immediate debate. An unspoken tension, however, still lingered in the humid air of the control room, thick and palpable. The lights on the main console blinked with renewed purpose, their glow reflecting in the wide, focused eyes of the navigator as her fingers flew across her terminal, charting the chosen course.\n\nA low thrum vibrated through the deck plating, a familiar song of the engines preparing for the jump. The captain leaned back in his command chair, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips as the final calculations appeared on the main viewscreen. Around the bridge, shoulders relaxed, the tension of decision-making easing into anticipation for the journey ahead.\n\nA soft murmur of agreement rippled through the group, a collective exhale as they absorbed the renewed stillness. The dying light cast long, dancing shadows, painting the familiar surroundings with an ephemeral, golden glow. A few exchanged knowing glances, a silent acknowledgment of the path chosen. The world outside their immediate circle seemed to hold its breath, waiting.\n\nA palpable stillness settled over them, the kind that prickles the skin and quickens the pulse. Elara found herself tracing the worn carvings on her amulet, a nervous habit she thought long conquered, while Liam’s gaze drifted towards the shadowed archway, his brow furrowed in concentration. The distant, rhythmic drip of water somewhere deep within the ancient stones was the sole sound punctuating the heavy silence. Even the torchlight seemed to flicker with a hesitant, watchful quality.\n\nThe oppressive quiet pressed in from all sides, thick and cloying, making the shadows cast by the flame dance with exaggerated menace. A faint, earthy scent, disturbed by their passage, hung heavy in the stagnant air. Glances, sharp and questioning, darted between them, unspoken anxieties tightening faces already stark in the flickering glow. Someone shifted their weight, the rustle of fabric unnaturally loud in the profound stillness.\n\nThe silence stretched, taut as a cable about to snap. Then, Elara, her goggles pushed up onto her forehead, pointed a trembling finger. \"There. Two compartments, etched into the bulkhead.\"\\nBarnaby grunted, levering open the first, smaller hatch with a crowbar. Inside, nestled on faded velvet, lay a neat row of aetherium power-cores, their gentle blue light a stark contrast to the flickering emergency lamps. \"Count 'em,\" he rasped.\\n\"Five,\" Elara confirmed, her voice hushed. \"Just 5.\"\\nHe moved to the second, larger hatch. It was significantly more reinforced. After several grunts and the screech of protesting metal, it groaned open a mere crack. A fierce, unstable thrumming emanated from within, accompanied by a blinding white light that forced them to shield their eyes. \"Can't get it further,\" Barnaby panted, wiping sweat from his brow. \"And look – the cores inside are… agitated. I can see at least 40, but they’re practically incandescent. Far too volatile for our current stabilizers. We can't risk taking even one of those.\"\\nElara nodded, her gaze fixed on the five stable cores from the first compartment. \"These 5 then,\" she stated, her voice firm despite the tremor in her hands. \"It's a modest yield, certainly less than the theoretical bounty of 'The Zenith Aether-Core', but that always carried the shadow of catastrophic overload. These are stable, manageable. This is the only viable quantity for us now if we intend to keep the *Wanderer* in one piece.\" She carefully picked up one of the cores, its surface cool and smooth beneath her gloved fingers. \"We proceed with these 5.\"\n\nA collective breath seemed to be held in the starkly lit chamber. The ambient hum of the surrounding machinery pulsed with a new, almost eager rhythm. Team members exchanged knowing glances, faces set with a mixture of steely resolve and unspoken anticipation. The air itself thrummed, charged with a quiet, expectant energy.\n\nA profound hush settled over the assembly, so deep it felt as if the world outside had ceased to turn. Eyes, wide and reflecting the dim light, darted between companions, seeking reassurance or finding only a mirror of their own taut nerves. Someone coughed, a dry, rasping sound quickly swallowed by the stillness. The scent of old stone and something akin to ozone, sharp and clean, pricked at their nostrils.\n\nShadows clung to the rough-hewn walls, seeming to deepen with every passing moment, swallowing the faint light that had guided them thus far. A collective shiver traced its way down spines, an unspoken acknowledgment of the sudden, profound stillness that had fallen. Eyes wide, they exchanged nervous glances, the earlier sharpness in the air now accompanied by a heavy sense of anticipation. The silence pressed in, broken only by the soft scuff of their boots on the dusty floor.\n\nThe air, thick with unspoken questions, tasted of ancient dust and something else, something metallic and unsettling. Elara’s gaze flickered towards Jian, her brow furrowed in a silent query that mirrored his own unease. He offered a barely perceptible nod, a small gesture of reassurance in the oppressive stillness. A faint draft, cold and unexpected, whispered from a shadowed archway ahead, drawing their attention.\n\nA collective shiver, quite separate from the sudden chill, danced down their spines. The air within the archway seemed to hum with a silent, ancient energy, a stark contrast to the stillness of the corridor they'd just traversed. Hesitation flickered in their eyes as they peered into the profound darkness, the scent of damp earth and something indefinably older reaching out to them. They paused, the draft now a more insistent caress against their faces.\n\nThe draft pushed them forward, stronger now, into a vast, circular chamber. Its ceiling was lost in the perpetual twilight above, but the source of the earthy scent was immediately apparent. Before them, nestled into alcoves carved with intricate, spiraling patterns almost too complex for the eye to follow, were four distinct collections of glowing crystals – aetherium power-cores, pulsating with a soft, internal light.\\nCaptain Eva Rostova stepped closer, her optical enhancers whirring. \"Report, Mr. Arkwright.\"\\nSilas Arkwright, ever meticulous, already had his chronometer and a small notation device out. \"Remarkable. These caches are untouched. An alcove here contains 4 cores. The subsequent one holds 26. Moving along… this one has 55, and the last one contains 73 cores.\" He looked up, a frown creasing his brow. \"Four distinct quantities. The legends of the Aetherium's Fulcrum spoke of a precise resonance, a specific measure needed to activate it.\"\\nEva nodded, her gaze distant as she recalled the cryptic clues, the hard-won understanding from 'The Core's Last Ember'. \"The Fulcrum seeks balance, Arkwright. A central point. We must arrange these values.\"\\nSilas quickly jotted them down: 4, 26, 55, 73. \"When ordered, Captain, the values 26 and 55 emerge as occupying the central region.\"\\nEva considered this. \"The Fulcrum is a delicate instrument, Arkwright. The principles gleaned from 'The Core's Last Ember' spoke of initiating power, not overwhelming it. Of these central options, one aligns with that: the lesser quantity. It represents the first threshold of balance, sufficient to awaken the Fulcrum without the risk of destabilization that a greater immediate influx might cause.\" She gestured decisively towards the alcove holding the specified cores. \"The 26 cores. That is the precise measure. It's the one that will serve the Fulcrum's purpose.\"\n\n---\n\n**Question:** Following the entire sequence of events described in the story, exactly how many aetherium power-cores did the characters end up with?
