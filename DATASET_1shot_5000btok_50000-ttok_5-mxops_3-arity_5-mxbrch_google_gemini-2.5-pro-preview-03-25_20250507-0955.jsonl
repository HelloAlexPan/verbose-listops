Check.\n- Characters: Jax is present and his quirk is mentioned. Anya is mentioned\n\n...slicked, neon-lit towers implied by \"neon bleed down the chrome canyons\". Check. Now for the ghostprint itself. Kaito slid through a narrow service duct, his boots barely finding purchase on the damp plasteel. The air in this forgotten sub-level tasted of ozone and decay. He found the first trace almost immediately: a small, discarded data-puck containing 5 corrupted chips, their surfaces shimmering with an unhealthy light. Deeper in, amongst a tangle of severed fiber optics, he uncovered a second, more substantial find of 51 chips. His search led him to three more distinct stashes: one with 56 chips nestled in a rusted junction box, another holding 68 chips tucked behind a humming, overloaded transformer, and a final, surprisingly large cache of 100 chips spilling from a cracked server module.\\n\\n\"Five separate deposits,\" Kaito muttered, laying them out on a grimy panel. He located an ancient data-consolidation unit nearby, its interface flickering erratically. \"Primitive, but it should do the trick.\" He carefully fed the contents of the five deposits into the unit's input slot. The machine groaned, lights blinked in a chaotic sequence, and a tiny, dust-covered display briefly showed 'INPUT SUM: 280 UNITS'. After a series of clicks and whirs, a single compartment slid open, revealing a neatly stacked pile. Kaito counted them. \"Exactly 56 chips. The average, floored. That's our next breadcrumb.\"\n\nKaito slipped the collection of circular tokens into his worn satchel. A palpable silence filled the cramped, dusty chamber as his companions absorbed the weight of his discovery. Glances were exchanged, a silent acknowledgment passing between them as the faint scent of old parchment and something metallic hung in the air. The next step, though unseen, seemed to loom large before them.\n\nThat acrid, metallic scent grew stronger, prickling their nostrils and hinting at something cold and unyielding. Silence, deep and profound, settled around them, amplifying the thudding of their hearts. With shared trepidation, glances passed between them, conveying the unspoken weight of the path forward.\n\nThe path forward led them deeper into the abandoned sub-levels of a forgotten data archive, the air thick with the smell of ozone and decay. Kaito, his augmented senses on high alert against the oppressive silence, was the first to spot a glint of tarnished silver beneath a collapsed conduit. He carefully brushed away decades of grime to reveal a small, discarded databank containing 57 corrupted data-chips. Not far off, Rina’s cryo-gloved hand emerged from a narrow ventilation shaft, clutching another 59 chips, their surfaces slick with condensation.\\n\\nThe search intensified, the silence broken only by their cautious movements and the drip of unseen water. Behind a sparking, half-detached server rack that groaned under its own weight, Kaito uncovered a denser cluster, his optical scanner quickly confirming 76 chips. The fourth and final discovery for this stage, a cache of 86 chips, lay nestled within the skeletal, rusted chassis of a long-dead maintenance drone, its optical sensors like vacant eyes.\\n\\nThey gathered the four distinct piles onto a makeshift tray Rina fashioned from a discarded panel. Kaito then brought out the shielded containment unit holding what they’d termed 'The Corruption’s Ghostprint'. With meticulous care, his fingers steady despite the thrumming tension in the air, he began to integrate the new finds. He fed in the pile of 57, then the collection of 59, followed by the larger group of 76, and finally the last cache of 86. As the final chip slotted home, the containment unit emitted a low, resonant hum, a subtle shift in its energy signature indicating the disparate fragments had coalesced, the ghostprint now fully fleshed out, its malevolent code finally complete.\n\nA palpable wave of dread washed over the assembled crew, cold and sharp as broken glass. Lieutenant Eva Rostova felt the hairs on her arms prickle, her gaze fixed on the shimmering, now solid, apparition that pulsed with an unnatural, sickening luminescence. The air grew heavy, thick with an unspoken threat, and the low hum of the ship’s engines seemed to falter, overshadowed by a silence more profound and terrifying than any battle cry. Every shadow in the control room deepened, stretching like grasping claws.\n\nThe air grew heavy, thick with unspoken dread, pressing down on shoulders like a physical weight. A collective intake of breath was the only sound, quickly stolen by the oppressive stillness. Eyes, wide and reflecting the dim emergency lights, darted towards the main viewscreen, searching for the source of this profound shift. The metallic tang of fear began to permeate the recycled air, sharp and undeniable.\n\n\\n\"The Glitch Yōkai\" (as a concept, an influence, an agent, but not its\\nnumeric value) must be used in the scene. The final result of the\\naveraging, 154, must be explicitly stated. The numbers 60 and 70 must\\nbe stated. The number 130 (the sum of 60 and 70) can be stated. The\\nnumbers \"one\" and \"two\" (as words) can be used. No other numbers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\n\nA profound stillness settled over the room, thick and almost tangible. Faces in the dim light reflected a mixture of contemplation and unease. Someone coughed, the sound unnaturally loud in the quiet. The speaker waited, observing the subtle shifts in expression before proceeding. This felt like a pivotal moment.\n\nThe air crackled with unspoken anticipation, a palpable hum vibrating between them. A slight tremor ran through a clasped hand, quickly stilled. Across the space, a jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. The silence stretched, heavy and expectant, as the world seemed to hold its breath alongside them.\n\nThe silence shattered as a low thrum vibrated through the deck plating. REX’s optical sensors flickered, adjusting to a sudden cascade of light from a previously dark alcove. \"Sub-level access,\" he stated, his voice a monotone hum. \"Two distinct data repositories detected within. Volatile signatures on both.\"\\n\\nKaelen moved first, his trench coat swirling around his augmented legs. He peered into the newly revealed space, a cramped server nook humming with stressed machinery. Two blinking consoles indicated the caches. \"Give me the readouts, REX.\"\\n\\n\"Repository Alpha contains 18 corrupted data-chips. Repository Beta contains 57 corrupted data-chips,\" REX announced. \"Warning: The integrity field around Beta is fluctuating dangerously. Attempting to access the larger cache risks a system-wide data purge.\"\\n\\nKaelen grunted. \"So, it’s Hobson's choice for the hardware. What about the signal itself? The Glitch's Resonant Hum we tracked here – how does its profile align with these concentrations?\"\\n\\nREX processed, coolant hissing softly. \"The Hum’s signature indicated a specific type of corruption, present in both repositories. However, given the instability, our priority must be minimal system impact. We are considering three potential extraction points: the source indicated by the Hum’s core resonance, Repository Alpha, and Repository Beta. The principle of least disturbance dictates our approach.\"\\n\\n\"The Hum pointed us to this nest, but these physical caches are our only way in now,\" Kaelen mused, tapping a finger against his chin. \"And if Beta blows, we get nothing. It has to be the smaller one. The path of least resistance, the smallest footprint.\" He looked at the console for Alpha. \"We take the 18. It's our only viable option without bringing the whole damn sector down on our heads.\" He picked up one interface cable, preparing to connect.\n\nThe air in the cramped access tunnel crackled with a nervous energy, thick enough to taste. His knuckles were white around the cable's connector, a bead of sweat tracing a path down his temple despite the recycled chill. Dim emergency lights cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with a life of their own. A low, almost sub-audible hum from the station's core systems provided a grim soundtrack to their desperate gamble.\n\nA palpable tension filled the cramped control room, thick as the metallic tang in the air. Sweat beaded on foreheads, eyes darted towards volatile status screens. The hum pulsed, a monstrous heartbeat beneath their feet, as they awaited the outcome of their perilous maneuver.\n\nThe status screens flickered from angry red to a stark, diagnostic white. Three distinct data signatures pulsed on the main display, branching pathways into the corrupted core. Kaito leaned closer, his augmented eye zooming in on the readouts. \"Target systems partially accessible,\" he muttered, tracing the lines of code that scrolled past. \"Looks like we've got three potential repositories for the Glitch Kernel fragments.\"\\n\\nAnya pointed to the quantitative analysis now populating beside each signature. \"One cache holds 16 corrupted data-chips, another 78, and the largest contains 85.\" Just as she spoke, a klaxon blared, soft but insistent. A new text overlay flashed across the displays: \"SYSTEM INTEGRITY COMPROMISED. POWER DIVERTED. MINIMAL EXTRACTION PROTOCOL ENGAGED.\"\\n\\n\"Damn it,\" Kaito hissed, slamming a fist lightly on the console. \"The bypass must have fried half the power conduits. The system can only stabilize one data stream for extraction – the smallest one.\"\\n\\nAnya’s expression tightened. \"So, it's the 16 chips, then. That's a meager haul. The patterns from the Ghost Byte suggested a far larger data set would be required to truly map the Kernel's spread.\"\\n\\n\"It's all we can safely retrieve,\" Kaito conceded, already initiating the transfer protocol for the smallest cache. \"The Ghost Byte also showed extreme instability. Perhaps this batch of 16, being less of a draw, will give us a cleaner, less volatile sample. It’s our only viable option right now.\" The hum beneath them shifted, a subtle change in pitch as the extraction sequence for the 16 chips began.\n\n---\n\n**Question:** Following the entire sequence of events described in the story, exactly how many corrupted data-chips did the characters end up with?

He pressed onward, deeper into the suffocating gloom, the cobblestones slick beneath his worn boots. The narrow alley eventually opened into a small, forgotten square, dominated by the crumbling façade of what might have once been a mausoleum. Within its shadow, Alistair discerned four distinct, recessed alcoves, each darker than the last.\\n\\nHolding his sputtering gas lamp aloft, he approached the first. Piled haphazardly on a moss-covered stone shelf were numerous lockets, identical in their shadowy etchings to the one he sought. He carefully counted them: there were 40.\\nThe second alcove, further to his right, contained a slightly larger collection. His count here reached 49 shadow-etched lockets, their metallic surfaces seeming to absorb the lamplight.\\nA shiver traced its way down Alistair’s spine as he moved to the third alcove. The air here felt colder, and the lockets, numbering 77, seemed to hum with a barely perceptible energy.\\nThe final, fourth alcove held the most significant trove: a staggering 84 lockets lay before him, almost spilling from their shelf.\\n\\nAs Alistair reached for one of the lockets from this largest pile, an icy gust of wind, originating from nowhere and everywhere at once, slammed the heavy stone door of the mausoleum shut behind him, plunging him into near total darkness save for his lamp. A disembodied whisper, like dry leaves skittering across flagstones, echoed around him. \"The path of least resistance... the smallest shadow...\" He instinctively understood. Some unseen force guarded these relics, permitting only the most modest claim. He tried to touch a locket from the cache of 77, but an invisible barrier, cold and unyielding, repelled his hand. The same occurred when he attempted to disturb the pile of 49. Only one option remained. He returned to the first alcove. \"It must be the 40,\" he breathed, the words swallowed by the oppressive silence. He reached out, and his fingers closed around the cold metal of the lockets without impediment. He gathered all 40, the weight of them a small, grim comfort in the oppressive darkness.\n\nThe air hung thick and still, a suffocating blanket that muffled even the sound of his own breathing. He clutched the collected items tighter, their familiar shapes a small anchor in the disorienting void. A bead of sweat traced a path down his temple as he shifted his stance, preparing for whatever lay ahead in the unseen depths. His senses strained, searching for any hint of movement or sound in the enveloping blackness.\n\nThe silence itself seemed to press in, a heavy blanket smothering all else. The darkness was so complete it felt like a physical weight against his eyelids, a tangible substance. A prickle of unease traced a path down his spine, cold and unwelcome. He swallowed, the sound unnaturally loud in the oppressive stillness, hoping for some break in the suffocating void.\n\n...wn his spine, cold and unwelcome. He swallowed, the sound unnaturally loud in the oppressive stillness, hoping for some break in the suffocating void.\\n\\nAnd then, a subtle shift. The oppressive silence fractured, replaced by a low thrumming that seemed to emanate from the very stones. Ahead, four shadowed niches glowed faintly, each revealing a cache of the dark lockets they sought. The first contained a small pile of 8. The next held 11. A larger cluster of 43 lay in the third, and the fourth niche was crammed with 78. He gathered them, the weight of the 140 lockets cold in his hands, a new offering for the path ahead.\\n\\nBefore them, a strange apparatus of tarnished brass and obsidian pulsed with the same low thrum. It had four distinct receptacles and a central crucible, clearly designed to process items such as these. It felt intrinsically linked to the lingering power of 'The Locket's Last Vestige', as if this new influx was a necessary component for its rebalancing. Carefully, he deposited the collections: 8 into one receptacle, 11 into another, then the 43, and finally the 78. The machine whirred, gears grinding as if calculating, its internal mechanism working to average the disparate quantities. Shadows danced within the crucible, merging with an unseen force drawn from the Vestige's essence. Then, with a final click, a compartment slid open, revealing a new, consolidated collection. He counted them meticulously: exactly 36 shadow-etched lockets, their surfaces gleaming with a deeper, more potent darkness.\n\nA collective gasp rippled through the assembled figures. The air in the chamber grew heavy, thick with an unspoken dread that clung to the very stones. Eyes, wide and reflecting the obsidian sheen of the artifacts, remained fixed on the array. A palpable silence descended, broken only by the faint, almost inaudible hum emanating from the lockets themselves.\n\nThe subtle vibration seemed to thrum in the very air, a palpable presence that made the dust motes dance in the slivers of moonlight piercing the gloom. Elara felt a shiver trace its way down her spine, an unbidden reaction to the growing resonance. Around them, the shadows in the chamber deepened, seeming to draw closer, as if the ancient stones themselves were listening intently to the lockets' song.\n\nThe song faded, leaving an expectant silence that pressed in with the darkness. As the oppressive shadows seemed to pulse, a faint, secondary resonance, an echo of the lockets' sorrowful tune, guided Alistair's gaze towards two previously unnoticed alcoves, carved into the far wall. Within the first, nestled on a bed of what looked like dried, blackened moss, lay a small cluster of shadow-etched lockets. He counted them carefully: 19.\\n\\nElara, meanwhile, had moved to the second alcove. \"Over here,\" she whispered, her voice tight, \"there are more.\" She held up her fingers, then confirmed, \"Precisely 49 of them.\"\\n\\nThey gathered the two sets, a total of 68 lockets, their metallic surfaces cold and strangely absorbing of the faint gaslight. A central, unadorned stone plinth, which they had previously overlooked, now seemed to hum with a subtle energy, resonating with the lingering power of 'The Shadowed Quintessence' that still clung to the air and to their own senses from the earlier ritual. Hesitantly, Alistair placed the group of 19 lockets upon it, followed by Elara with the 49.\\n\\nAs the last locket touched the stone, the combined collection of 68 shimmered. A low thrum emanated from the plinth. The lockets began to vibrate, some more intensely than others. One by one, several of the lockets dissolved into fine, shadowy dust, which was then absorbed into the remaining ones, the plinth itself seeming to guide the arcane averaging. The process was unnervingly selective. When the unsettling transformation ceased, a distinct, smaller collection remained. Elara leaned in, her breath catching. \"There are... 34,\" she confirmed, her voice barely audible. \"Exactly 34.\" The plinth fell silent, the newly refined set of lockets now pulsing with a concentrated, potent darkness.\n\nThe air in the chamber grew perceptibly colder, a sudden draft snaking around Xinth's ankles despite the still-warm forge. Shadows in the corners seemed to deepen, stretching like grasping claws, and a profound silence settled, heavy and expectant. Xinth himself remained utterly still, his gaze fixed on the lockets, a flicker of triumph in his otherwise unreadable eyes.\n\nA profound stillness settled over the chamber, the only sound the faint crackle of the nearby hearth. Elara watched him, her own heart thudding a nervous rhythm against her ribs, the earlier tension now morphing into a wary anticipation. He finally lowered his hand, the lockets cool against his palm, a subtle shift in the room's oppressive weight accompanying the movement. The moment stretched, taut and fragile, before the inevitable continuation.\n\nThe groan of stone against stone answered the unspoken question, a section of the far wall receding into the gloom. Beyond, three shadowed alcoves awaited, revealed by the shifting architecture. Within the first, nestled on velvet that had long since surrendered to dust, lay a scattering of shadow-etched lockets; a quick, hushed count confirmed 37. The second alcove, deeper and colder, offered up a larger, more unsettling trove of 56 such trinkets, each one seemingly colder than the last. And the third, almost hidden by a fall of ancient masonry, contained a significant pile of 93, their surfaces gleaming faintly even in the oppressive darkness.\\n\\nA low, obsidian pedestal stood in the chamber's desolate center, its surface bare save for an indentation that pulsed with a faint, familiar energy – the lingering echo of the Shadowed Keynote. As if sensing the presence of the newly discovered artifacts, three shallow depressions shimmered into existence on its surface. Carefully, they placed the lockets into these, one distinct group at a time. The pedestal vibrated, a low thrum that seemed to acknowledge the total offerings, the sum of 186 pieces briefly flaring as an almost imperceptible numeral in the stagnant air above them before fading. Then, drawing upon the resonance from the Keynote's spectral impression, the pedestal glowed with an intense, internal light. A subtle grinding sound, and the many lockets began to merge, to refine, their individual forms blurring under the arcane pressure. When the light finally subsided, a single, concentrated collection remained upon the stone: precisely 55 shadow-etched lockets, imbued with a deeper, more potent darkness than any they had yet encountered.\n\nA palpable chill seeped from the lockets, causing the torchlight to flicker erratically and painting dancing, distorted shapes upon the ancient stone walls. Gasps caught in throats as a profound sense of unease settled upon the group, heavier than the dust of ages. Fingers, moments before eager, now hesitated, hovering just above the malevolent trinkets. The silence that followed was absolute, broken only by the frantic thumping of hearts against ribs.\n\nThe air itself seemed to solidify, growing heavy and charged, pressing in from all sides. Shadows danced in the periphery of their vision, elongating into grotesque shapes that mimicked their deepest anxieties. A collective, unspoken question hung suspended in the stillness, as palpable as the sudden chill that raised gooseflesh on exposed skin. Someone swallowed, the sound unnaturally loud in the suffocating quiet. Each strained to listen, to perceive any hint of what might break the spell.\n\nThen, a faint, rhythmic scraping, like bone against stone, cut through the oppressive silence, originating from deeper within the passage. Alistair, his face a grim mask in the flickering gaslight, gestured. They advanced, footsteps muffled by the thick layer of dust coating the flagstones. The unsettling sound led them to a narrow, shadowed alcove, almost entirely concealed by a recent fall of rubble. Elara, her breath held tight, carefully prised open a small, rotted wooden coffer half-buried there. Inside, glinting with a malevolent sheen, lay 19 shadow-etched lockets. \"Another cache,\" she whispered, the words barely audible as she began to gather them.\\nMoments later, from an even deeper recess just beyond the first, Silas let out a low, sharp hiss. \"And here.\" He pointed with a trembling finger to a second, similar coffer, this one yielding 20 more of the grim, cold trinkets. They collected these two new sets, the chill of the metal seeping into their gloved hands. Alistair then produced the heavy leather satchel, already burdened with the lockets meticulously gathered from the patterns of The Recurring Sigil. One by one, he added the newly discovered pieces – first the group of 19, then the additional 20 – to the existing hoard. As the final locket clinked softly against its fellows, the satchel seemed to achieve a new, profound density. The Lockets’ Assembled Whisper, once a fragmented, discordant murmur in their minds, now resonated with the chilling clarity of a complete chorus, the full, ominous count finally achieved.\n\n---\n\n**Question:** Following the entire sequence of events described in the story, exactly how many shadow-etched lockets did the characters end up with?

He withdrew his silver pocket watch, its surface already gleaming, and polished it again with a gloved thumb, a ritual against the unease that prickled his skin. The air itself felt charged, a low thrumming vibration that spoke of raw ley-line energy, potent and untamed.\\n\"It grows stronger, Finch,\" a voice, cool and measured, cut through the swirling grey. Lady Thorne emerged from the mist like a phantom, her dark attire barely disturbing the opaque curtain. \"The sigil pulses nearby. We must locate the resonance points.\"\\nThey moved deeper into the alley, their footsteps muffled. Lady Thorne, with an almost preternatural sense, stopped before a crumbling alcove. \"One discovery,\" she announced, her gaze fixed on a collection of faintly shimmering stones nestled within. \"There are 27 Whispering Geodes here.\"\\nFinch, meanwhile, had spotted another cluster pulsating with a soft, internal light beneath a dislodged paving stone. \"And here, 37 more,\" he called out, carefully extracting them.\\nThey pressed on, uncovering a further cache within the gnarled roots of an ancient, soot-stained oak that somehow survived in this urban blight, containing 55 geodes, and finally the largest deposit of 60 lay concealed behind a loose brick in a derelict warehouse wall, their collective hum now a palpable chorus.\\nLady Thorne directed Finch to lay all four distinct groups of geodes upon a large, flat stone slab they'd cleared in the alley's center. As the last of the 60 joined the others, the full collection, all 179 geodes, began to resonate violently. A blinding, cerulean light erupted from the pile, forcing them both to shield their eyes. The air crackled, and the very cobblestones beneath their feet vibrated. When the light subsided, a gasp escaped Finch. Of the considerable pile, only a scant few remained, glowing with an intense, pure light. The rest had crumbled into inert, grey dust. Lady Thorne, unfazed, stepped forward and counted them. \"Precisely nine,\" she stated, a hint of triumph in her voice. \"The resonant sigil accepts only the core essence. We have what we need.\"\n\nA quiet thrum replaced the previous cacophony, the air tasting faintly of ozone and ancient dust. Elara lowered her gaze from the now quiescent sigil, a weary but satisfied smile touching her lips. Beside her, Roric let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding, his knuckles white where he gripped his staff. The flickering torchlight cast long, dancing shadows, painting their relieved expressions in stark contrast.\n\nThe air, thick with the scent of damp stone and burnt wick, still hummed with the recent tension, a palpable echo in the cavernous space. A collective sigh, almost silent, seemed to ripple through the small group as shoulders visibly slumped. Weary smiles began to replace the taut lines around their eyes, the torchlight softening their features further. Someone leaned heavily against the cool, rough-hewn wall, the scrape of fabric a quiet sound in the sudden stillness.\n\nThe figure was Silas, his breath misting in the chill air that clung to the hidden tunnel. He pushed himself upright, weariness etched onto his face. \"Anything, Elara?\"\\nHer voice was a low murmur from deeper in the passage. \"Perhaps. This way feels… different.\"\\nHe followed her, the beam of his oil lamp cutting a swathe through the oppressive darkness. The tunnel opened abruptly into a small, circular chamber, hewn from the same dark stone. Set into the curved walls were four distinct alcoves, like shadowed mouths.\\n\"Whispering Geodes,\" Elara breathed, stepping closer. \"And in considerable numbers.\"\\nThe first alcove, directly before them, held a small scattering of the pulsating crystals; Silas counted them quickly in the lamplight – 13 geodes. The next, to their right, was more densely packed, containing what looked to be 30. The third alcove held even more, a shimmering pile of 46. And the last, opposite the first, seemed to brim with them, easily 51 or more.\\nA faint, almost inaudible hum emanated from the three larger caches, and the stone slabs sealing them pulsed with a faint, sickly green light. \"Arcane locks,\" Silas observed, his hand hovering near the one with 30. \"Too strong for us, I suspect.\"\\nElara nodded, her gaze fixed on the first, smallest cache. Its simple wooden door, dark and ancient, hung slightly ajar. \"This one, however, seems accessible. The only one.\"\\nSilas turned his attention to it. \"The Geode's Resonant Sigil… its pattern didn't speak of overwhelming numbers, Elara. It hinted at a precise, foundational harmony.\"\\n\"Indeed,\" she agreed, her eyes thoughtful. \"When we consider the Sigil's true implication against these discovered quantities – these 13 here, and the 30, 46, and 51 in the sealed alcoves – the Sigil’s guidance points to a far more specific, a much smaller, critical number. It is that specific resonance, the smallest and most potent value indicated by our previous workings, that we must seek.\" She reached into the accessible alcove. \"This cache holds 13, more than we require. The Primal Note demands exactitude. We take only the nine geodes the Sigil has guided us to.\"\\nCarefully, Elara selected nine of the softly glowing stones, their faint whispers seeming to coalesce as she gathered them. The remaining few in the alcove pulsed a little dimmer, as if in acknowledgment.\n\nHer fingers tightened around the collection, a faint warmth already seeping into her palm. A quiet breath escaped her, a mixture of relief and the lingering strangeness of the alcove's response. The very air seemed to still further, the remaining glow casting long, dancing shadows that stretched towards the entrance. She shifted her weight, the gathered objects held securely, preparing to move onward.\n\nShe stepped forward, crossing the threshold into a space that hummed with a low, resonant energy. Dust motes danced in the slivers of light piercing the gloom from unseen sources. A shiver, not entirely from cold, traced its way down her spine as her eyes adjusted to the dimness. The air hung heavy, thick with the scent of aged stone and something else, something indefinably ancient.\n\n\\n7: Yes, Jasper mentions Primal Note leading to median.\\n    \\n    Jasper: \"Right, the Primal Note led us to expect the median. We have 6, 22, and 87 geodes.\"\\n    \\n    Elara: \"The median of 6, 22, and 87 is 22. We take the cache of 22.\"\\n    \\n    Output: The four caches yielded 6, 22, and 87 Whispering Geodes, plus one more from the Primal Note. Jasper consulted his notes. \"The Primal Note indicated the median value. From 6, 22, and 87, the median is 22.\" Elara nodded, \"So we take the cache containing 22.\"\n\nElara's decisive nod cut through the tense silence. A palpable wave of anticipation seemed to ripple through the dusty air of the forgotten vault. Kaelen offered a slight, encouraging smile, his gaze fixed on the designated cache. With a shared glance, they prepared to approach their objective, the weight of their decision settling upon them.\n\nThe air grew thick, almost cloying, as if the very environment sensed their impending action. A muscle twitched in the leader's jaw, a silent testament to the strain. Another exchanged a grim nod with their companions, a silent acknowledgement of the path ahead. Shadows seemed to lengthen prematurely, stretching like grasping fingers towards them, amplifying the sense of foreboding.\n\nThe faint, almost inaudible hum they’d been following grew stronger here, at the path's edge, pulling them towards a gnarled oak whose roots clawed at a crumbling section of an ancient, moss-slicked wall. Alistair, his lantern casting dancing, distorted figures, peered into a shadowed alcove formed by the oak’s largest root. “Here,” he breathed, the sound swallowed by the fog. “One cache, I think.” Carefully, he reached in and retrieved a small cluster of pulsating stones: 11 Whispering Geodes, their sorrowful, collective sigh barely a breath in the oppressive quiet.\\n\\nA few paces further, where the wall sagged precariously, Elara’s gloved hand, tracing the subtle vibrations in the air, paused. “And another,” she announced, her voice low. From a crevice between two dislodged foundation stones, she drew out a significantly larger find. These were 49 more of the strange, luminous geodes, their combined hum a more distinct, mournful chorus that resonated in the chill.\\n\\nThey laid their two new discoveries upon a relatively flat stone. Elara produced the worn leather pouch containing the geodes from 'The Geode's Stillpoint'. With a shared glance of understanding, she untied its drawstring and added the new treasures – first the group of 11, then the larger collection of 49 – to those already nestled within. The pouch, now noticeably heavier, pulsed with a complex, unified thrum, its chorus of whispers intensified, almost a tangible presence in the fog-laden air.\n\nThat presence now felt like a physical weight, pressing down, making each breath a conscious effort. The fog, already dense, seemed to congeal around them, muffling the world beyond the immediate, suffocating reach of their senses. A hand instinctively rose to a throat, a purely reflexive gesture against the unseen pressure.\n\nThe oppressive stillness that followed was a blanket, smothering any thought of outcry. Pupils dilated in the gloom, each person a statue carved from fear, barely daring to breathe. A low thrum began to vibrate through the floor, a subtle tremor that promised something more. The scent of ozone, sharp and clean, pricked at their nostrils, a strange counterpoint to the mounting dread.\n\nThe very flagstones beneath their boots shifted, grinding open to reveal a shallow, circular depression previously hidden. Within it, four distinct niches pulsed with a faint, internal luminescence, the source of the intensified ozone.\\nAlasdair knelt, peering into the first. \"By the Serpent's Coil... more geodes.\" He pointed. \"This small alcove contains 19 of them.\"\\nEleonora moved to the next. \"This one holds 71.\" Her voice was hushed. A faint, almost invisible shimmer seemed to guard the smaller collections, a ripple in the air that hummed with raw, unstable power.\\n\"And here, 83,\" Alasdair announced from the third niche, cautiously waving his hand near the shimmering field. \"It appears we can only interact with the one that draws the most power. The ley-energy is too... volatile around these lesser concentrations.\"\\nEleonora reached the final, largest niche. \"Then this must be it. This one contains 97 Whispering Geodes.\" She looked at Alasdair. \"The Geode's Chorus, all those intricate patterns we traced, it spoke of a final, dominant harmony, didn't it? A singular, powerful voice to complete the song.\"\\nAlasdair nodded, his gaze fixed on the largest cache. \"It did. If the Chorus was a true guide, and given that the path is only clear to this one, the most potent collection... then 97 it is. The culmination.\"\\nHe reached out, finding the air before the cache of 97 geodes strangely calm, the protective shimmer absent here. \"Only one way to be certain.\"\n\n---\n\n**Question:** Following the entire sequence of events described in the story, exactly how many Whispering Geodes did the characters end up with?

He wasn't looking for fire; he was looking for answers.\\n\\nHis augmented vision highlighted four faint energy signatures behind a loose durasteel panel. Prying it open, he found four small, shielded containers. The first one he examined yielded 9 corrupted data-chips. The second held 21, shimmering faintly with malevolent code. The third container was heavier, containing 44 chips, and the fourth, almost overflowing, held 50.\\n\\nJax gathered all 124 chips from the four batches. Nearby, a dormant data-syphon, an antique even by this district's standards, hummed faintly as he approached. He carefully loaded the chips into its input slots. The machine shuddered, ancient processors groaning. Lights flickered across its grimy interface. Then, with a decisive clunk, one tray extended. On it lay a neatly stacked pile of 31 consolidated data-chips, the syphon having performed some crude averaging of the volatile inputs, discarding the excess fragments. One step closer to the Core Glitch, or one step deeper into the mire. Jax wasn't sure which, but he took the chips.\n\nThe datachips hummed faintly in Jax's grasp, a subtle vibration against his skin that sent a shiver up his arm despite the oppressive warmth of the service tunnel. Around him, the usual symphony of failing machinery played its mournful tune, a backdrop of groaning pipes and intermittent electrical crackles. He tucked the vital components away, their weight a sudden, tangible anchor in the swirling uncertainty of his mission. The path forward was shrouded in deeper shadows, promising little comfort.\n\nA palpable stillness settled, the kind that prickled the skin with unseen watchers. He drew a slow breath, the stale, earthy scent of the passage filling his lungs, a stark contrast to the open air he'd left behind. With a grim set to his jaw, he took a tentative step, his boots scuffing softly against the unseen floor, each sound amplified in the suffocating quiet. The oppressive dark seemed to swallow the faint light that had guided him thus far.\n\nHe gritted his teeth, activating the low-light optical enhancers in his cybernetic eye. The world resolved into grainy monochrome, just enough to navigate. He swept the beam of his hand-mounted lumensphere across the derelict server room. Tucked into a dusty alcove, beneath a cascade of severed fiber optics, lay two plasteel containers. The first, its seal already corroded, creaked open to reveal a cache of 58 corrupted data-chips, their surfaces flickering with a sickly green light. The second container, heavier and still magnetically locked, required a jolt from his neural taser to bypass. Inside, another 76 chips pulsed with a more aggressive, crimson energy. He gathered all 134 volatile fragments, adding them to the datapad where the unstable remnants of the Core Glitch already resided. The moment he initiated the diagnostic to assess their combined signature, the datapad shrieked—a high-frequency burst that vibrated through his bones. The screen flashed an intense, pure white, and an invisible force seemed to scour the data within. It felt like a digital exorcism, a voracious entity consuming the chaotic code, leaving only the most resilient essence. When the light faded and the device fell silent, its casing strangely cold, he checked the directory. Only five data-chips remained, now glowing with a calm, steady blue light, the chaotic storm within them seemingly quelled and distilled. The rest had vanished, as if claimed by some unseen digital warden.\n\nA profound stillness settled over the control center, the previous digital cacophony now a mere echo in their minds. Elara shivered, despite the room's regulated temperature, her gaze sweeping across the blank monitors where information had teemed moments prior. Marcus ran a hand through his hair, a silent testament to the bewilderment that gripped them all as the very air seemed to crackle with an invisible, watchful energy.\n\nA profound stillness descended, heavy and expectant, broken only by the sharp, collective intake of breath from those gathered. Wide, uncertain eyes scanned the now eerily quiet surroundings, searching fruitlessly for the origin of the potent shift in the environment. A subtle, almost imperceptible hum replaced the crackling, vibrating deep within their chests, a silent testament to the lingering power. The very stones beneath their feet seemed to hold their breath, waiting.\n\nThe oppressive silence stretched, then fractured as the very air before them seemed to ripple. Two recessed compartments in the wall, previously invisible, now pulsed with a sickly green luminescence. Inside each lay a discarded heap of data-chips, their surfaces filmed with grime and the tell-tale flicker of corruption.\\n\\nKaelen’s augmented eye scanned them methodically. \"Analysis complete,\" he announced, his voice a low gravel. \"We have two distinct caches. The first contains 50 corrupted data-chips. The second, further recessed, holds 79.\"\\n\\nMira touched the spot on her temple where the Resonance Glyph’s imprint still felt warm. \"The Resonance Glyph… its nature was fundamental, a core signal. It resonated with a value less than either of these discoveries.\" She looked at Kaelen, her eyes narrowed in concentration. \"If we consider the conceptual 'weight' of the Resonance Glyph, and then these two new quantities, 50 and 79, the directive was to find the median. The true path is illuminated by the middle value.\" She pointed to the smaller of the two stashes. \"Therefore, the collection of 50 chips is the one we need. The Glyph’s influence, being less than 50, makes 50 the median when ordered with 79.\"\\n\\nKaelen gave a curt nod. \"One correct choice. The logic is sound.\" He moved towards the indicated compartment.\n\nA low hum vibrated through the floor plates as he approached, the sound growing slightly in intensity. The air in the corridor felt suddenly colder, carrying a faint, almost chemical tang that pricked at their nostrils. Behind him, a few hushed whispers ceased, replaced by an expectant silence. The latch of the compartment clicked with a decisive sound under his touch.\n\nThe metallic tang of old mechanisms, now released, mingled with the stale air of the confined space. A collective intake of breath, sharp and sudden, was the only sound that dared to break the spell. Eyes, wide and reflecting the dim light, fixed upon the narrow opening, every individual present leaning forward almost imperceptibly, drawn by an unseen current of anticipation.\n\nThe dim light from the narrow opening spilled into a cramped, forgotten access conduit. Two tarnished plasteel lockers sat recessed into the far wall, their status lights blinking erratically. Jax, his cybernetic eye whirring, focused on the first. A grimy display panel above it flickered, then stabilized: \"Corrupted Data Cache Alpha - Contents: 16 units.\" He shifted his gaze to the second, larger locker. Its panel read: \"Corrupted Data Cache Beta - Contents: 94 units.\"\\n\\n\"Network security protocols are archaic on this node,\" REX’s synthesized voice echoed from Jax’s comm-link. \"Primitive failsafe. You can only interface with the cache holding the smaller quantity. An attempt to access the larger one first will trigger a data purge across both.\"\\n\\n\"So, it's the 16 chips, then,\" Anya stated, her hand hovering over the release mechanism of the first locker. She glanced at Jax. \"The intelligence we gleaned from The Fulcrum Shard… it painted a picture of a system highly reactive to large data incursions. This new find, these 16 chips, presents one distinct value for consideration. The conceptual data-weight derived from the Shard’s own matrix was substantially greater. Between those two possibilities – the modest 16 we can retrieve now, versus the much larger signature implied by the Shard's full operational potential – we must select the smallest. It’s our only way to proceed without tripping every alarm from here to the corporate spire.\"\\n\\nJax nodded slowly, the single red dot of his optical implant unwavering. \"The path of minimal disturbance. We take the 16. It’s the one option that keeps us ghosts in their machine.\"\n\nA palpable tension filled the cramped space, the air thick with unspoken anxieties and the faint, metallic tang of old machinery. Shadows danced along the walls, cast by a flickering emergency light, mirroring the uncertainty in their eyes. Shoulders, previously slumped in thought, straightened with a newfound, albeit reluctant, resolve. A subtle shift occurred, a silent agreement passing between them before they prepared to move.\n\nThe air in the dim chamber grew thick with unspoken anticipation. A faint rustle of fabric accompanied their slight adjustments of posture. Eyes, previously locked, now scanned the immediate surroundings, cataloging exits and potential obstacles. A shared breath, almost imperceptible, signaled their readiness.\n\nKaelen moved first, his optical sensors cutting through the gloom of the abandoned server farm. \"Here,\" he hissed, pointing to a trio of heavily shielded data vaults, their access panels flickering erratically. \"Three distinct signatures. Corrupted, all of them.\"\\n\\nJax interfaced with the nearest console, his cyberdeck humming. \"Reading them now. Vault Alpha shows a cluster of 9 compromised chips. Beta is hotter, registering 19 of them. Gamma... Gamma is practically screaming. It’s holding 48 corrupted data-chips.\" His fingers danced across the interface. \"Damn. The access system is daisy-chained with a failsafe. If we attempt to extract from a lesser source, it triggers a full system purge of all three. We have one shot, and it has to be at the densest cluster to ensure we retrieve anything at all.\"\\n\\nKaelen nodded grimly. \"So, Gamma it is. The 48 chips. This concentration dwarfs what 'The Glitch Kernel' analysis suggested we'd find. If the Prime Infector's core is anywhere, it's where the corruption is thickest. This is the one we need.\" Jax initiated the delicate bypass sequence for Vault Gamma, the console whining before finally granting access to the cache containing 48 chips.\n\n---\n\n**Question:** Following the entire sequence of events described in the story, exactly how many corrupted data-chips did the characters end up with?

A ping on his comm, a new ghost in the machine, promised another dive into the datastream's churning chaos.\\n\\nKaito jacked in, the cold tendrils of the Net wrapping around his consciousness. The ghost, a whisper in the digital wind, led him through collapsing firewalls and screaming server archives. In a forgotten sector, shimmering faintly, lay the first cache: 18 corrupted data-shards. Deeper still, past a gauntlet of glitch-hounds, he uncovered a second cluster containing 38 shards. A third pocket, nestled within a looping paradox of code, yielded 48 more. The final source, scattered across four heavily encrypted nodes, provided another 77 shards. Kaito meticulously gathered them all. He initiated the consolidation protocol, feeding the 18 shards into his collection matrix, followed by the 38, then the 48, and finally the 77. The system processed the influx, merging the distinct quantities into one volatile, unified stream of compromised data, the entirety of his dangerous harvest now secured.\n\nA quiet hum filled the otherwise silent room, a stark contrast to the digital tempest he had just navigated. Relief washed over him, a slow exhale releasing the coiled tension in his shoulders. The faint, steady glow of the console screen painted his weary face as he savored the moment. He closed his eyes briefly, the cool, still air a welcome balm.\n\nA profound quietness settled in, broken only by the distant, indistinct murmur of what might have been dripping water or shifting earth. His shoulders, previously tensed, relaxed a fraction, the lines of strain on his face softening slightly. The air itself seemed to hold its breath, a silent anticipation hanging heavy.\n\nThe heavy silence was broken by a series of faint, rhythmic pulses emanating from a darkened alcove. Kaelen gestured. \"There. More components for the Key, I'd wager.\"\\nInside, they found not one consolidated source, but distinct clusters of corrupted data-shards. The first, nestled within a cracked server casing, yielded 5 glimmering fragments. A nearby conduit, sparking intermittently, held a denser collection of 38 shards. Deeper still, almost swallowed by encroaching bio-luminescent fungi, they carefully extracted a final cache of 68 shards.\\n\"That makes 111 new pieces,\" Mara confirmed, her voice low as she gathered the disparate hauls. She held out the combined 111 shards. \"Ready to integrate with The Glitch Mosaic?\"\\nKaelen nodded, his eyes already fixed on the chaotic, shimmering nexus of data they had painstakingly assembled. \"It's time. Let the pattern resolve.\"\\nMara approached The Glitch Mosaic, its unstable energy prickling her skin. With a steady hand, she introduced the 111 newly acquired shards to its periphery. As the last fragment made contact, the entire construct – the fresh shards and the volatile core of The Glitch Mosaic – erupted in a silent, blinding flash of emerald light. A shockwave of pure data, devoid of sound, washed over them, pressing them back. When their senses recalibrated and the overwhelming luminescence subsided, the vast, swirling vortex of information was gone. In its place, on the cool metal of the console where the chaos had roiled, lay 2 perfectly formed, stable data-shards, pulsing with a soft, rhythmic glow. Only 2.\n\nThe residual energy from the chaotic event slowly dissipated, leaving behind a heavy silence in the chamber. A collective breath seemed to hang suspended, the soft, rhythmic glow of the data-shards painting faint, pulsing patterns on tense faces. The meager result, far less than anticipated, cast a pall over the initial surge of excitement. Eyes remained fixed on the glowing objects, a silent question lingering in the air.\n\nA soft hum emanated from the artifacts, vibrating through the floor and into the soles of their boots. Brows furrowed in concentration as individuals leaned imperceptibly closer, drawn by an unseen force. The silence stretched, taut and electric, each heartbeat a drum against the backdrop of the strange, ethereal glow. A subtle shift in the light painted their faces in new, otherworldly hues.\n\nThe ethereal glow pulsed, a silent invitation deeper into the datastream's haunted heart. Kaito followed its pull, Lena a shadow at his side, navigating through corridors of shimmering, unstable code. Before them, the light coalesced around four distinct data nodes, each one leaking a viscous, corrupted energy. An interface flickered to life on each as they approached.\\n\\n\"Look,\" Lena whispered, her voice barely cutting through the hum of the digital ether. \"Shard counts.\"\\n\\nKaito leaned closer, his optical implants whirring faintly as he scanned the readouts. The first node pulsed with 54 corrupted data-shards. The next, slightly brighter, showed 72. A third, flickering erratically, held 59. The final one displayed a count of 71. Four distinct concentrations of the decay they sought.\\n\\n\"The Ghost Cycle Key,\" Kaito murmured, his gaze distant as he processed the information. \"It spoke of balance, a fulcrum point found not at the extremes, but at the core, the median.\" He traced the air, visualizing the numbers. \"If we arrange these quantities – 54, 59, 71, and 72 – the middle ground isn't a single point, but a threshold between two.\"\\n\\nLena nodded. \"Between 59 and 71 shards.\"\\n\\n\"Precisely,\" Kaito confirmed. \"And the Key’s logic, its inherent preference for the genesis of a pattern, guides us to the lower of those two central values. The point where the balance first begins to tip. We need the cache with 59.\" He turned towards the third node, the one with the flickering light, a grim certainty settling on his features. \"That one is our path to the Fulcrum.\"\n\nA heavy silence followed his pronouncement, the flickering light casting restless shadows across their solemn faces. Each individual present seemed to process the weight of the statement, a mixture of grim acceptance and nervous anticipation painting their features. The air grew thick with unspoken questions, yet a shared understanding, a silent accord, passed between them. They would proceed.\n\nA palpable tension settled around them, the air growing heavy with unspoken possibilities. Shadows stretched long and distorted from the meager light source, painting the rough-hewn walls with a somber hue. A shared glance, resolute and unwavering, confirmed their silent pact. With a nearly imperceptible nod, they turned towards the waiting unknown.\n\nThe heavy plascrete door hissed open before them, revealing a server room humming with a low, guttural thrum. Banks of obsolete hardware lined the walls, their indicator lights blinking erratically in the gloom, casting long, dancing shadows that writhed with the flickering neon glow filtering in from the street far below. A faint scent of ozone and long-dead circuits hung heavy in the air.\\n\\nKaelen moved first, his optical implant already scanning the dim interior, painting his vision with augmented reality overlays. \"Two potential sources,\" he murmured, his voice a low rumble barely audible above the server drone. \"Localized corrupted shard clusters.\"\\n\\nRaina followed, her hand instinctively going to the custom data-spike holstered at her hip. \"Show me.\"\\n\\nKaelen gestured with a sweep of his hand. \"Here, and here.\" Two archaic server racks stood apart from the others, isolated islands in the sea of forgotten tech, each glowing with a faint, sickly luminescence that pulsed like a diseased heart. \"This one,\" he indicated the nearer of the two, \"contains a cluster of 59 corrupted data-shards. The other,\" his gaze shifted to the farther unit, \"holds a significantly larger concentration: 100 shards.\"\\n\\nA soft, almost apologetic chime emanated from Kaelen's implant. \"Access protocol is degraded,\" he reported, a frown creasing his brow. \"The system can only handle one extraction, and it's flagging the larger packet as highly unstable. Attempting to retrieve the 100 shards will almost certainly trigger a full data purge and an immediate lockdown. We can only safely access the smaller one.\"\\n\\nRaina nodded slowly, her eyes fixed on the pulsing racks. \"The Ghost-Line Fulcrum advised caution,\" she recalled, her voice steady. \"A light touch. Taking the path of least resistance, the smallest viable signature to avoid waking deeper, more dangerous systems.\" She looked from one rack to the other. \"Between 59 and 100, the choice is clear if we want to avoid immediate catastrophe. The system itself dictates it, and it aligns with the Fulcrum's guidance.\"\\n\\n\"Agreed,\" Kaelen said, his focus already narrowing. \"We proceed with the 59 shards. It's our only viable option here, and it fits the profile we're looking for – minimal impact, maximum discretion.\" He moved towards the first rack, the one containing the 59 shards, and began to unfurl his interface tools, the metallic clicks sharp in the humming silence.\n\nThe low, resonant hum of the chamber seemed to deepen, a subtle pressure against the eardrums. Dust motes, previously unseen, swirled in the faint glow emanating from the unfurling instruments, catching the light like tiny, fleeting stars. A shared breath was held, the silence otherwise profound, broken only by the delicate whirring and snapping of the intricate tools coming online. The air grew colder, or perhaps it was just the prickle of rising tension.\n\nA low hum vibrated through the deck plating, almost imperceptible beneath their boots, a subtle counterpoint to the chill. Kyra unconsciously rubbed her arms, her gaze fixed on the newly illuminated console lights that flickered with nascent purpose. Across the bridge, Jax tightened his grip on the railing, his knuckles showing pale against the dark metal. The silence stretched, taut and expectant, as the ship prepared itself for what was to come.\n\nThe ship’s internal systems whined, a high-frequency thrum that vibrated through Kael’s synth-leather chair as it interfaced directly with the Core’s primary data nexus. On the main holographic display, tangled skeins of light resolved into accessible pathways. He navigated towards two prominent signatures of corrupted data. The first pulsed with a chaotic energy, revealing 28 glitched data-shards. Deeper within the datastream, a second, more volatile cluster materialized, containing 99 such shards. Kael initiated the retrieval protocol, his gloved fingers dancing over the console. The system aggregated the new finds, a volatile collection of 127 fragments, into a secure buffer. He then took a breath, a rare moment of stillness, before committing them. This new batch, combined with the lingering, unstable resonance of The Echoing Bit, was channelled into the Core’s purification conduit. A blinding surge of azure light erupted from the interface, a silent scream of data being torn apart and reformed. The light flared, consuming the vast majority of the inputted code, then gracefully subsided.\n\n---\n\n**Question:** Following the entire sequence of events described in the story, exactly how many corrupted data-shards did the characters end up with?
