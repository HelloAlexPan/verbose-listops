The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow.

Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow. Borin shifted his weight, the leather of his armor creaking softly, his gaze sweeping the now-dim chamber as if searching for echoes of the departed radiance. Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep. They stood there for a time, letting the world settle, letting their own hearts find a steady rhythm again, the cool, real stone beneath their boots a welcome anchor....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly.

Borin's keen eyes spotted a small cluster of Celestial Orbs tucked into a crevice near the floor. He counted them carefully: a distinct group of **four**. Deeper within the chamber, Kaelen found a collection in a shallow niche along the wall, revealing **six** Celestial Orbs nestled together. Moving further around the perimeter, Elara located another group, also of **six** Celestial Orbs, resting on a narrow ledge just out of reach.\n\nAs they ventured towards the center of the space, a solitary arrangement of **seven** Celestial Orbs pulsed with a faint, steady light unlike the others. It felt significant, positioned with deliberate care. Beyond it, a scattered pattern of **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs lay strewn across the floor, as if dropped in haste. Finally, near the far wall, Borin uncovered a large cache containing **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, a veritable hoard compared to the others.\n\nThey gathered near the central arrangement, the different quantities of Orbs they had found spread out or marked in their minds' eye. Borin gestured to the various discoveries. \"So many different counts... a chaotic distribution.\"\n\nKaelen knelt by the solitary arrangement they had found earlier. \"But this one,\" he said, his voice hushed, \"it feels different. Not the most, not the least, but perfectly balanced among them. Its position... its energy signature... it feels like the pivot point.\"\n\nElara nodded slowly, her gaze fixed on the **seven** orbs before them. \"The point of equilibrium,\" she murmured, understanding dawning in her eyes. \"The heart around which the others align.

Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene.

Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.

Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.'

This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4.

Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140).

(e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow. Borin shifted his weight, the leather of his armor creaking softly, his gaze sweeping the now-dim chamber as if searching for echoes of the departed radiance. Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep.

Borin's keen eyes spotted a small cluster of Celestial Orbs tucked into a crevice near the floor. He counted them carefully: a distinct group of **four**. Deeper within the chamber, Kaelen found a collection in a shallow niche along the wall, revealing **six** Celestial Orbs nestled together. Moving further around the perimeter, Elara located another group, also of **six** Celestial Orbs, resting on a narrow ledge just out of reach.\n\nAs they ventured towards the center of the space, a solitary arrangement of **seven** Celestial Orbs pulsed with a faint, steady light unlike the others. It felt significant, positioned with deliberate care. Beyond it, a scattered pattern of **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs lay strewn across the floor, as if dropped in haste. Finally, near the far wall, Borin uncovered a large cache containing **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, a veritable hoard compared to the others.\n\nThey gathered near the central arrangement, the different quantities of Orbs they had found spread out or marked in their minds' eye. Borin gestured to the various discoveries. \"So many different counts... a chaotic distribution.\"\n\nKaelen knelt by the solitary arrangement they had found earlier. \"But this one,\" he said, his voice hushed, \"it feels different. Not the most, not the least, but perfectly balanced among them.

Focus on: ensuring the number 'seven' appears exactly 1 time as an input, and ensuring the numerical result 'seven' is not stated when referring to the outcome group ('Celestial Axis').\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'seven' (value: 7) was explicitly stated again ('fixed on the seven orbs') when referring to the group identified as the outcome ('Celestial Axis'). For a MEDIAN operation, the numerical result must be implied via the conceptual name ('Celestial Axis') and not stated numerically in that context. The first mention of 'seven' as an input is correct, but the second mention referring to the outcome group is forbidden.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the frequency for 'seven' and the Rule 2 violation, remove the second mention of 'seven'. The sentence 'Elara nodded slowly, her gaze fixed on the seven orbs before them.' could be rephrased to refer to the group conceptually or by its position, without using the number 'seven' again, e.g., 'Elara nodded slowly, her gaze fixed on the solitary arrangement before them.'\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The beat text contains violations of the numerical and storytelling rules.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b.

Finally, near the far wall, Borin uncovered a large cache containing **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, a veritable hoard compared to the others.\n\nThey gathered near the central arrangement, the different quantities of Orbs they had found spread out or marked in their minds' eye.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime').

Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene.

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow. Borin shifted his weight, the leather of his armor creaking softly, his gaze sweeping the now-dim chamber as if searching for echoes of the departed radiance. Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep.

Borin knelt, running a gloved hand over the flagstones near the chamber's edge. \"There,\" he murmured, his voice low.

Kaelen, examining a collapsed section further in, found a larger cache containing **six** of the luminous spheres. Deeper in the chamber, near a strange glyph, Elara discovered another distinct collection, also numbering **six** Celestial Orbs. Further searching yielded a significant find – a cache holding **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs. Tucked away in a high alcove, almost hidden from view, was a smaller group of **seven** Celestial Orbs.

This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Prime') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Borin knelt, running a gloved hand over the flagstones near the chamber's edge. \"There,\" he murmured, his voice low. His keen eyes spotted a small cluster nestled in a crevice – a group of **four** Celestial Orbs. Kaelen, examining a collapsed section further in, found a larger cache containing **six** of the luminous spheres. Deeper in the chamber, near a strange glyph, Elara discovered another distinct collection, also numbering **six** Celestial Orbs. Further searching yielded a significant find – a cache holding **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs. Tucked away in a high alcove, almost hidden from view, was a smaller group of **seven** Celestial Orbs. And finally, near the chamber's entrance, they located the largest deposit yet – a staggering **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs.\n\nThey brought the disparate collections together, arranging them on a flat stone. The smallest cluster sat to one side. Caches of similar size were placed next to it. Then came the slightly larger group, followed by the significantly bigger cache, and finally, the truly massive deposit. As they studied the arrangement, Elara pointed to the collection of seven orbs. \"Look,\" she murmured. \"Among all these, this particular group... it feels like the center. Not just in position, but in resonance. It's the balancing point between the smaller and larger quantities.\" Borin nodded slowly, his gaze fixed on the luminous spheres. \"The others orbit its significance,\" he rumbled. \"This must be it.

The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene.

SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow. Borin shifted his weight, the leather of his armor creaking softly, his gaze sweeping the now-dim chamber as if searching for echoes of the departed radiance. Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep.

This revision MUST meticulously address all issues identified by the validator below, while also re-adhering to ALL original rules for this scene. Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**\n```text\nThe cool, real stone beneath their boots was a welcome anchor, but the silence felt heavy, expectant. Borin knelt, running a gloved hand over the flagstones near the chamber's edge. \"There,\" he murmured, his voice low. His keen eyes spotted a small cluster nestled in a crevice – a group of **four** Celestial Orbs. Kaelen, examining a collapsed section further in, found a larger cache containing **six** of the luminous spheres. Deeper in the chamber, near a strange glyph, Elara discovered another distinct collection, also numbering **six** Celestial Orbs. Further searching yielded a significant find – a cache holding **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs. Tucked away in a high alcove, almost hidden from view, was a smaller group of **seven** Celestial Orbs. And finally, near the chamber's entrance, they located the largest deposit yet – a staggering **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs.\n\nThey brought the disparate collections together, arranging them on a flat stone. The smallest cluster sat to one side. Caches of similar size were placed next to it. Then came the slightly larger group, followed by the significantly bigger cache, and finally, the truly massive deposit. As they studied the arrangement, Elara pointed to the collection of seven orbs. \"Look,\" she murmured. \"Among all these, this particular group... it feels like the center. Not just in position, but in resonance. It's the balancing point between the smaller and larger quantities.\" Borin nodded slowly, his gaze fixed on the luminous spheres. \"The others orbit its significance,\" he rumbled. \"This must be it. The **Celestial Axis**.\"\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2 (Explicit Result). Focus on: ensuring the required input 'seven' appears exactly once, and ensuring the operation's result 'seven' is implied via 'Celestial Axis' without using the number word 'seven' again.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) as a distinct input but was found 2 time(s). This is an over-count. The first mention (a smaller group of seven Celestial Orbs) correctly fulfills the input requirement. The second mention (collection of seven orbs) is extraneous for Rule 1.A input counting.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'seven' (value: 7) was explicitly stated (collection of seven orbs) when identifying the median group ('Celestial Axis'). For a MEDIAN operation, the numerical result must NEVER be explicitly stated; it must only be implied via the conceptual name 'Celestial Axis'. The second mention of 'seven' violates this rule.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the frequency of 'seven' and ensure the result is implicit, remove the explicit mention of 'seven' when identifying the 'Celestial Axis' group. Instead of 'Elara pointed to the collection of seven orbs.', consider phrasing like 'Elara pointed to this particular group...' or 'Elara pointed to the group they had found in the high alcove...'. This refers to the group conceptually without restating the number 'seven'.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The beat violates multiple rules regarding numerical frequency and the handling of the operation's result.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) as a distinct input but was found 2 time(s). This is an over-count. The first mention (\"a smaller group of seven Celestial Orbs\") correctly fulfills the input requirement. The second mention (\"collection of seven orbs\") is extraneous for Rule 1.A input counting.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'seven' (value: 7) was explicitly stated (\"collection of seven orbs\") when identifying the median group ('Celestial Axis').

If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Prime') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Borin knelt, running a gloved hand over the flagstones near the chamber's edge. \"There,\" he murmured, his voice low. His keen eyes spotted a small cluster nestled in a crevice – a group of **four** Celestial Orbs. Kaelen, examining a collapsed section further in, found a larger cache containing **six** of the luminous spheres. Deeper in the chamber, near a strange glyph, Elara discovered another distinct collection, also numbering **six** Celestial Orbs. Further searching yielded a significant find – a cache holding **twenty-one** Celestial Orbs. Tucked away in a high alcove, almost hidden from view, was a smaller group of **seven** Celestial Orbs. And finally, near the chamber's entrance, they located the largest deposit yet – a staggering **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs.\n\nThey brought the disparate collections together, arranging them on a flat stone. The smallest cluster sat to one side. Caches of similar size were placed next to it. Then came the slightly larger group, followed by the significantly bigger cache, and finally, the truly massive deposit. As they studied the arrangement, Elara pointed to this particular group. \"Look,\" she murmured. \"Among all these, this collection... it feels like the center. Not just in position, but in resonance. It's the balancing point between the smaller and larger quantities.\" Borin nodded slowly, his gaze fixed on the luminous spheres. \"The others orbit its significance,\" he rumbled. \"This must be it.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Celestial Orbs' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Celestial Prime'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('seven') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Prime') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'four' (4), 'twenty-one' (21), 'six' (6), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'twenty-seven' (27) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'Celestial Axis' (which represents the median value 'seven'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'seven' (7) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'Celestial Axis' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('seven') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'seven' (7) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Prime') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' and NOT restate 'seven' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow. Borin shifted his weight, the leather of his armor creaking softly, his gaze sweeping the now-dim chamber as if searching for echoes of the departed radiance. Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep.

Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**\n```text\nSlowly, they began to move, their boots crunching on fallen stone dust. The chamber was vast, its edges lost in shadow, but littered with the debris of ages. They split up, flash-lamps cutting swathes through the gloom, searching for anything missed in the initial chaos. Borin found a cluster first, nestled in a cracked pedestal – a small cache of Celestial Orbs, numbering just **four**. Further along, near a collapsed archway, Kaelen unearthed a sealed lead box containing a larger collection – **twenty-one** of the glowing spheres. Elara, exploring a niche behind a crumbling statue, discovered a tightly packed grouping – precisely **six** Celestial Orbs. Deep within a narrow fissure, Borin called out again, having found another, distinct pocket – another **six** of the shimmering orbs. Kaelen then located a scattered trail leading to a hidden cavity; within lay **seven** Celestial Orbs, pulsing faintly. Finally, Elara found a large, ornate chest, mostly buried, which held a significant hoard – **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, their light muted by the ancient wood.\n\nThey gathered the discovered orbs, placing them carefully on a flat stone surface, the different quantities laid out before them. The light they cast was varied, some bright, others dim. They looked at the disparate piles, considering their meaning. They also remembered the power of **The Celestial Prime**, the immense energy they had just witnessed, a force that felt like a cornerstone to all these smaller findings.\n\n\"So many,\" Borin murmured, gesturing at the collections.\n\nKaelen knelt, his fingers hovering over the different groups. \"We have these... and the echoes of **The Celestial Prime**.\" His gaze settled on the group numbering **seven**. \"Look at these,\" he said softly. \"Compared to the others, these seem... centered. Balanced. Not the fewest, not the most, not clustered with the others of similar count. They feel like the pivot point, the still eye in the storm of all this rediscovered power.\"\n\nElara nodded slowly, her eyes fixed on the **seven** orbs. \"Yes,\" she breathed. \"The axis around which the others might turn. The core frequency.\"\n\nKaelen carefully picked up one of the **seven** orbs, its light steady and calm. \"This group,\" he declared, holding the single orb aloft, \"this is the **Celestial Axis**.\"\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2 (Explicit Result), Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number). Focus on: ensuring 'seven' appears exactly 1 time as a direct input description, and ensuring the operation's result is implied via 'Celestial Axis' without using the number 'seven' again to identify the result group.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) as a direct input but found 3 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous mentions of the number 'seven' (value: 7) were found. Rule 1.A only justifies 1 instance of 'seven' as an input. The additional 2 instances are not justified by Rule 1.A or a valid Rule 3 use, violating Rule 5.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'seven' (value: 7) was explicitly stated multiple times when identifying the group that represents the result ('Celestial Axis'). Rule 2 requires the numerical result to be implicit via 'Celestial Axis', not stated numerically, even though 'seven' is also a Rule 1.A input. The narrative should describe the single input group of seven and then identify the median group as 'Celestial Axis' without using the number 'seven' again in that context.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. Reduce the total mentions of 'seven' to exactly one (1). This single mention should occur when describing one of the input groups.    2. When identifying the group that represents the median result ('Celestial Axis'), refer to it conceptually or by its position relative to the other groups (e.g., 'this central group', 'the pivot point') but DO NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again in that context.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The beat text violates multiple rules regarding numerical frequency and the handling of the operation's result.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) as a direct input but found 3 time(s).

Finally, Elara found a large, ornate chest, mostly buried, which held a significant hoard – **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, their light muted by the ancient wood.\n\nThey gathered the discovered orbs, placing them carefully on a flat stone surface, the different quantities laid out before them.

They feel like the pivot point, the still eye in the storm of all this rediscovered power.\"\n\nElara nodded slowly, her eyes fixed on the group Kaelen indicated. \"Yes,\" she breathed. \"The axis around which the others might turn.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Prime') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The chamber was vast, its edges lost in shadow, but littered with the debris of ages. They split up, flash-lamps cutting swathes through the gloom, searching for anything missed in the initial chaos. Borin found a cluster first, nestled in a cracked pedestal – a small cache of Celestial Orbs, numbering just **four**. Further along, near a collapsed archway, Kaelen unearthed a sealed lead box containing a larger collection – **twenty-one** of the glowing spheres.

SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The air still hummed, a low thrum deep within the bones of the earth, a memory of power clinging to the dust motes that danced in the faint residual glow.

Kaelen rubbed his eyes, the spectral colours slowly fading from his vision, the vast, ancient silence pressing in. Elara hugged her arms, not from cold, but from the sheer immensity of what they had just witnessed, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. She met Kaelen's gaze across the space between them, a shared understanding passing without a word. The shadows seemed to watch them now, patient and deep.

Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 2):**\n```text\nSlowly, they began to move, their boots crunching on fallen stone dust. The chamber was vast, its edges lost in shadow, but littered with the debris of ages. They split up, flash-lamps cutting swathes through the gloom, searching for anything missed in the initial chaos. Borin found a cluster first, nestled in a cracked pedestal – a small cache of Celestial Orbs, numbering just **four**. Further along, near a collapsed archway, Kaelen unearthed a sealed lead box containing a larger collection – **twenty-one** of the glowing spheres. Elara, exploring a niche behind a crumbling statue, discovered a tightly packed grouping – precisely **six** Celestial Orbs. Deep within a narrow fissure, Borin called out again, having found another, distinct pocket – another **six** of the shimmering orbs. Kaelen then located a scattered trail leading to a hidden cavity; within lay **seven** Celestial Orbs, pulsing faintly. Finally, Elara found a large, ornate chest, mostly buried, which held a significant hoard – **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, their light muted by the ancient wood.\n\nThey gathered the discovered orbs, placing them carefully on a flat stone surface, the different quantities laid out before them. The light they cast was varied, some bright, others dim. They looked at the disparate piles, considering their meaning. They also remembered the power of **The Celestial Prime**, the immense energy they had just witnessed, a force that felt like a cornerstone to all these smaller findings.\n\n\"So many,\" Borin murmured, gesturing at the collections.\n\nKaelen knelt, his fingers hovering over the different groups. \"We have these... and the echoes of **The Celestial Prime**.\" His gaze settled on the group they had found numbering **seven**. \"Look at these,\" he said softly. \"Compared to the others, this particular group seems... centered. Balanced. Not the fewest, not the most, not clustered with the others of similar count. They feel like the pivot point, the still eye in the storm of all this rediscovered power.\"\n\nElara nodded slowly, her eyes fixed on the group Kaelen indicated. \"Yes,\" she breathed. \"The axis around which the others might turn. The core frequency.\"\n\nKaelen carefully picked up one orb from that specific group, its light steady and calm. \"This group,\" he declared, holding the single orb aloft, \"this is the **Celestial Axis**.\"\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 2):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2 (Explicit Result). Focus on: exact counts for required inputs, ensuring result is implicit.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'seven' (value: 7) was explicitly stated (numbering seven) when identifying the median group, but should be implicit via 'Celestial Axis'. This second mention of 'seven' also contributes to the Rule 1.A frequency over-count.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the count for 'seven' and the Rule 2 violation, remove the explicit mention of \"numbering seven\" when Kaelen identifies the median group. The identification should rely on its position/characteristics relative to the other groups, leading to the conceptual name 'Celestial Axis', without using the number word 'seven' again. For example, rephrase Kaelen's line to something like: \"His gaze settled on that particular group. Look at these... Compared to the others, this group seems... centered. Balanced. Not the fewest, not the most, not clustered with the others of similar count. They feel like the pivot point...\"\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The generated beat text violates multiple rules from the Generator's Writing Guide.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seven' (value: 7) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'six' (6): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'four' (4) and 'six' (6) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'seven' (7) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-seven' (27). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('seven' (7)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'seven' (7) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('seven') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'seven' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'seven Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'seven' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'Celestial Axis', you MUST NOT use the word 'seven' or the digit '7' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'seven Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'Celestial Axis') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'seven', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it Celestial Axis.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...Celestial Axis represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'seven' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'Celestial Axis'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'eight' (8), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Prime'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'seven' (7)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Prime') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The chamber was vast, its edges lost in shadow, but littered with the debris of ages. They split up, flash-lamps cutting swathes through the gloom, searching for anything missed in the initial chaos. Borin found a cluster first, nestled in a cracked pedestal – a small cache of Celestial Orbs, numbering just **four**. Further along, near a collapsed archway, Kaelen unearthed a sealed lead box containing a larger collection – **twenty-one** of the glowing spheres. Elara, exploring a niche behind a crumbling statue, discovered a tightly packed grouping – precisely **six** Celestial Orbs. Deep within a narrow fissure, Borin called out again, having found another, distinct pocket – another **six** of the shimmering orbs. Kaelen then located a scattered trail leading to a hidden cavity; within lay **seven** Celestial Orbs, pulsing faintly. Finally, Elara found a large, ornate chest, mostly buried, which held a significant hoard – **twenty-seven** Celestial Orbs, their light muted by the ancient wood.\n\nThey gathered the discovered orbs, placing them carefully on a flat stone surface, the different quantities laid out before them. The light they cast was varied, some bright, others dim. They looked at the disparate piles, considering their meaning. They also remembered the power of **The Celestial Prime**, the immense energy they had just witnessed, a force that felt like a cornerstone to all these smaller findings.\n\n\"So many,\" Borin murmured, gesturing at the collections.\n\nKaelen knelt, his fingers hovering over the different groups. \"We have these... and the echoes of **The Celestial Prime**.\" His gaze settled on that particular group. \"Look at these,\" he said softly. \"Compared to the others, this group seems... centered. Balanced. Not the fewest, not the most, not clustered with the others of similar count.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Celestial Orbs'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'Celestial Axis') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-eight').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-eight' (28) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Star's Eye' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-eight' (28) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' and NOT restate 'twenty-eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene.

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Celestial Orbs'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'Celestial Axis') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-eight').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-eight' (28) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Star's Eye' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-eight' (28) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' and NOT restate 'twenty-eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-eight' (28)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark.

Focus on: ensuring the number 'two' appears exactly once as a Rule 1.A input and removing any phrases that summarize or re-list the inputs, especially those using numbers not justified by Rule 1.A or valid Rule 3 use.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'two' (value: 2) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 1.B (Re-listing): Detected a phrase that re-lists/summarizes input numbers, likely causing frequency errors for Rule 1.A. The phrase: 'They stood amidst the disparate discoveries, the faint gleam of the smaller finds paling beside the sheer power radiating from the two largest caches. Of all the orbs unearthed, the magnitude of these final two finds was undeniable.' This sentence uses the number 'two' to refer to the number of largest groups found, which is a form of re-listing/summarizing the inputs rather than introducing a new input quantity.    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous number 'two' (value: 2) was found in the phrase 'two largest caches' / 'final two finds'. This instance of 'two' is not justified as a Rule 1.A input (it does not represent a group of 2 orbs being introduced) and is not among the numbers permitted for general phrasing by Rule 3 for this beat. Its presence violates Rule 5.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the frequency of 'two' and remove the extraneous number/re-listing, remove the sentence 'They stood amidst the disparate discoveries, the faint gleam of the smaller finds paling beside the sheer power radiating from the two largest caches. Of all the orbs unearthed, the magnitude of these final two finds was undeniable.'

This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-eight' (28)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

A profound stillness settled around them, broken only by the faint, rhythmic sound of their own passage, drawing them further into the mountain's unyielding heart.

Further along, in a narrow fissure, they found **four** more, glowing with a slightly brighter intensity. Entering a wider chamber, a breathtaking sight awaited them – a scattered cluster of **eight** orbs pulsed with soft energy. Pushing deeper, they discovered a more substantial cache within a collapsed section of wall, containing **seventeen** orbs, their combined radiance filling the space. Their search led them into a vast cavern where a significant hoard lay partially exposed, revealing **twenty-one** orbs, their light a steady beacon. Then, their breath caught. Before them, in a crystalline formation, was a truly immense concentration of **twenty-eight** Celestial Orbs, their brilliance almost overwhelming. And as if the mountain itself wished to test their resolve, a hidden passage nearby opened into a smaller grotto, holding yet another equally vast collection – **twenty-eight** more of the radiant orbs. They stood amidst the disparate discoveries, the faint gleam of the smaller finds paling beside the sheer power radiating from the largest caches. They focused their attention on one, its singular, overwhelming power marking it as the most significant discovery. This, they knew, was the heart of the mountain's secret, the preeminent find.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Celestial Orbs'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'Celestial Axis') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-eight').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-eight' (28) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Star's Eye' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-eight' (28) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' and NOT restate 'twenty-eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark.

It also correctly used 'one' under Rule 3 and avoided other numbers (Rule 5) and prior result names (Rule 6). HOWEVER, it included the number 'seventeen' (value: 17), which is explicitly listed as forbidden by Rule 4.

Please re-read ALL rules carefully.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To strictly comply with Rule 4, the number 'seventeen' (value: 17) must be removed from the text. Note that removing 'seventeen' would then cause a violation of Rule 1.A, which requires 'seventeen' exactly one time. This indicates a conflict in the rules provided to the generator (Rule 1.A requiring 'seventeen' vs. Rule 4 forbidding 'seventeen').

If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.'

Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a.

(e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-eight' (28)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'Celestial Axis') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Celestial Orbs'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'Celestial Axis'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'Celestial Axis') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'four' (4), 'two' (2), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-eight').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-eight' (28) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Star's Eye' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-eight' (28) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' and NOT restate 'twenty-eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'four' (4): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They moved deeper, the lantern’s trembling glow barely pushing back the absolute dark.

All other required numbers ('two', 'four', 'eight', 'twenty-one', 'twenty-eight') were present with the correct frequencies as per Rule 1.A. Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries) was followed. Rule 2 (Outcome Handling) was followed; the result ('twenty-eight') was not explicitly stated as the outcome but implied via 'The Star's Eye', and its mentions were correctly limited to the Rule 1.A input requirements. Rule 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes) was followed; the use of 'one' was sparing and not a Rule 1.A input or Rule 4 forbidden. Rule 4 (Forbidden Numbers) was followed; no forbidden numbers were present. Rule 5 (No Other Numbers) was followed; no extraneous numbers were present. Rule 6 (Prior Results) was N/A as 'Celestial Axis' was not mentioned.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the count for 'seventeen', ensure it appears 1 time as a distinct narrative element representing an input. Currently, it appears 0 times.

This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'four' (4) and 'eight' (8) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-eight' (28) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-eight' (28) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Star's Eye' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-eight' is required 2 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 2 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 2 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-eight' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Star's Eye', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-eight' or the digit '28' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-eight Celestial Orbs' 2 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Star's Eye') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Star's Eye.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Star's Eye represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 2 mention(s) of 'twenty-eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Star's Eye'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'Celestial Axis'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-eight' (28)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Star's Eye'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Celestial Orbs' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'eight' (8), 'ten' (10), 'nine' (9), 'twenty-four' (24), 'nine' (9); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Star's Eye'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Celestial Orbs' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Star's Eye') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'ten' (10), 'nine' (9), 'twenty-four' (24), 'nine' (9) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Celestial Key' (representing the value 'eight'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'eight' (8) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Celestial Key' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'eight' (8) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Celestial Key' and NOT restate 'eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'nine' (9) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'ten' (10) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'eight' (8) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Key' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eight' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eight' is the outcome (i.e., the sum modulo 10). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Celestial Key', you MUST NOT use the word 'eight' or the digit '8' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eight Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Celestial Key') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - SM - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Celestial Key.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Celestial Key represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Celestial Key'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Star's Eye'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...e and something else, something wild and untamed. Elara closed her eyes for a moment, letting the cavern's pulse resonate through her, a deep, slow beat that felt older than time itself.

Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Celestial Key') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - SM - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Celestial Key.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Celestial Key represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Celestial Key'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Star's Eye'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...e and something else, something wild and untamed. Elara closed her eyes for a moment, letting the cavern's pulse resonate through her, a deep, slow beat that felt older than time itself. Borin sighed softly beside her, a sound lost almost instantly in the profound quiet, his gaze still fixed on the source of the light, a silent reverence in his posture. Kaelen remained a still, watchful presence, his attention sharp, scanning the edges of the chamber where the light failed and the true darkness began. Each breath they took felt deliberate, loud in the stillness, a fragile counterpoint to the immense, silent power that filled the space. The shadows danced, not randomly, but with a strange, almost purposeful grace, as if they were living things, observing them in turn. A chill, not of cold but of immense age, settled upon their skin. The silence deepened, becoming a tangible weight, pressing upon their thoughts, urging them to simply *be* in the presence of something vast and unknowable....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly. Do not add titles, notes, or anything outside the story itself.", "generator_output": "The silence deepened, becoming a tangible weight, pressing upon their thoughts, urging them to simply *be* in the presence of something vast and unknowable. Elara broke the spell, her voice a low murmur. \"We must gather them. All of them.\" She gestured towards the glowing core of the chamber, where the energy of 'The Star's Eye' pulsed. Carefully, reverently, they began the process. From a hidden niche in the rock face, Borin retrieved a cluster of **eight** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces cool despite the ambient warmth. Kaelen, examining a crystalline growth near the chamber's edge, discovered a vein containing **ten** more, embedded like luminous jewels. Elara herself located a small, intricately carved box holding **nine** orbs, their light muted but steady. Deeper within the chamber, almost hidden by shadow, lay a larger cache – a spill of **twenty-four** orbs, scattered across a natural pedestal. Finally, tucked into a high, narrow fissure, they found another group of **nine** orbs, nestled together.\n\nAs each quantity was added to the area around 'The Star's Eye', the chamber's resonance intensified. The individual lights merged, swirling into a single, blinding vortex of energy. It didn't simply grow brighter; it began to cycle, to pulse with an intricate, internal rhythm. Elara raised the focusing crystal, directing the chaotic energy onto a flat, ancient stone. The light settled, forming a dynamic pattern that shifted and reformed continuously. It was a complex, fluid dance, a visual representation of the energy's core nature. Kaelen leaned closer, his eyes sharp. \"Look,\" he said, pointing. \"The full cosmic pulse contains ten distinct moments, yes, but the fundamental pattern, the repeating core essence... it manifests as a sequence of eight distinct phases before it begins anew.\" Borin nodded slowly, a look of profound understanding dawning on his face. This repeating sequence, this fundamental rhythm, this was the essence they sought. This was the heart of the chamber's power.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'nine' (9) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'ten' (10) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'eight' (8) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Key' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eight' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eight' is the outcome (i.e., the sum modulo 10). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Celestial Key', you MUST NOT use the word 'eight' or the digit '8' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eight Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Celestial Key') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - SM - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Celestial Key.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Celestial Key represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Celestial Key'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Star's Eye'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.

Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'eight' (8)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Key'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a.

Elara broke the spell, her voice a low murmur. \"We must gather them. All of them.\" She gestured towards the glowing core of the chamber, where the energy of 'The Star's Eye' pulsed. Carefully, reverently, they began the process. From a hidden niche in the rock face, Borin retrieved a cluster of **eight** Celestial Orbs, their surfaces cool despite the ambient warmth. Kaelen, examining a crystalline growth near the chamber's edge, discovered a vein containing **ten** more, embedded like luminous jewels. Elara herself located a small, intricately carved box holding **nine** orbs, their light muted but steady. Deeper within the chamber, almost hidden by shadow, lay a larger cache – a spill of **twenty-four** orbs, scattered across a natural pedestal. Finally, tucked into a high, narrow fissure, they found another group of **nine** orbs, nestled together.\n\nAs each quantity was added to the area around 'The Star's Eye', the chamber's resonance intensified. The individual lights merged, swirling into a single, blinding vortex of energy. It didn't simply grow brighter; it began to cycle, to pulse with an intricate, internal rhythm. Elara raised the focusing crystal, directing the chaotic energy onto a flat, ancient stone. The light settled, forming a dynamic pattern that shifted and reformed continuously. It was a complex, fluid dance, a visual representation of the energy's core nature. Kaelen leaned closer, his eyes sharp. \"Look,\" he said, pointing. \"The full cosmic pulse contains ten distinct moments, yes, but the fundamental pattern, the repeating core essence... it manifests as a sequence of eight distinct phases before it begins anew.\" Borin nodded slowly, a look of profound understanding dawning on his face.

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Celestial Orbs' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'eight' (8), 'ten' (10), 'nine' (9), 'twenty-four' (24), 'nine' (9); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Star's Eye'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Celestial Orbs' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Star's Eye') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eight' (8), 'ten' (10), 'nine' (9), 'twenty-four' (24), 'nine' (9) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Celestial Key' (representing the value 'eight'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'eight' (8) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Celestial Key' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('eight') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'eight' (8) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Celestial Key' and NOT restate 'eight' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'nine' (9) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'ten' (10) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'eight' (8) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Key' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eight' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eight' is the outcome (i.e., the sum modulo 10). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Celestial Key', you MUST NOT use the word 'eight' or the digit '8' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eight Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Celestial Key') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - SM - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Celestial Key.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Celestial Key represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Celestial Key'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Star's Eye'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...e and something else, something wild and untamed.

Focus on: ensuring exact counts for required inputs ('eight' 1 time, 'ten' 1 time), ensuring the result ('eight') is implied via 'The Celestial Key' and not explicitly stated, and removing extraneous numbers like the second mention of 'ten'.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'eight' (value: 8) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count. The first mention ('eight Celestial Orbs') fulfills the input requirement. The second mention ('eight distinct phases') is extraneous to the input count.    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'ten' (value: 10) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count. The first mention ('ten more') fulfills the input requirement. The second mention ('ten distinct moments') is extraneous to the input count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'eight' (value: 8) was explicitly stated ('eight distinct phases') when identifying 'The Celestial Key'. Rule 2 requires the result to be implied, not stated, even though 'eight' is also a Rule 1.A input. The 1 required mention of 'eight' is for the input quantity only.    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous number 'ten' (value: 10) was found in the phrase 'ten distinct moments'. This mention is not justified by Rule 1.A (as it's an over-count for the input) or a valid Rule 3 use (as 'ten' is not listed in Rule 3), and thus violates Rule 5.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. Remove the phrase 'ten distinct moments' to fix the Rule 1.A frequency over-count for 'ten' and the Rule 5 violation.    2. Rephrase the description of 'The Celestial Key' to imply the value 'eight' without using the word 'eight'. For example, instead of 'it manifests as a sequence of eight distinct phases', describe a characteristic or property of the pattern that corresponds to the value eight, or simply state 'This repeating sequence... This, they knew, was 'The Celestial Key'' after describing the pattern's nature without quantifying it numerically.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The generated beat text violates multiple rules from the Generator's Writing Guide.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'eight' (value: 8) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

The second mention ('ten distinct moments') is extraneous to the input count.\nVIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'eight' (value: 8) was explicitly stated ('eight distinct phases') when identifying 'The Celestial Key'. Rule 2 requires the result to be implied, not stated, even though 'eight' is also a Rule 1.A input. The 1 required mention of 'eight' is for the input quantity only.\nVIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous number 'ten' (value: 10) was found in the phrase 'ten distinct moments'. This mention is not justified by Rule 1.A (as it's an over-count for the input) or a valid Rule 3 use (as 'ten' is not listed in Rule 3), and thus violates Rule 5.\"*\n**MANDATORY PRE-REVISION CHECKLIST (Confirm your plan before rewriting):**\n1.  **Error Understanding:** Have you read and understood EACH specific issue and action item listed above from the validator?\n2.  **Rule 1.A Correction Plan (If Applicable):** For any missing or miscounted numbers, do you have a NEW, concrete plan for how and where you will narrate each required instance distinctly, ensuring exact frequencies as per the original Rule 1.A?\n3.  **Rule 2 Correction Plan (If Applicable):** Is your new plan for the outcome purely conceptual, completely avoiding the numerical result if it was previously stated?

If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.'

This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'nine' (9) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'ten' (10) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'eight' (8) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Key' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eight') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eight' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eight Celestial Orbs' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eight' is the outcome (i.e., the sum modulo 10). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Celestial Key', you MUST NOT use the word 'eight' or the digit '8' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eight Celestial Orbs' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Celestial Key') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eight', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - SM - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Celestial Key.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Celestial Key represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eight' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Celestial Key'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'one' (1), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'one' (1), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'sixty-eight' (68), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Star's Eye'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'eight' (8)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Key'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

The central items of interest are the 'Celestial Orbs'.\nImagine your characters are gathering or combining distinct collections of 'Celestial Orbs'. Some of these collections might be newly found or counted, corresponding to the numbers (and their frequencies): 'eighteen' (18), 'eight' (8), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirty' (30). Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Astral Core'. Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Astral Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'eight' (8), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirty' (30) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Heart'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred forty') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred forty' (140) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Celestial Orbs', so that 'The Celestial Heart' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'eight' (8): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Celestial Orbs') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred forty' (140) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Heart' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-two' (22), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Astral Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative.

Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Celestial Orbs'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Celestial Orbs in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Celestial Orbs.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Celestial Orbss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Celestial Orbs in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Celestial Orbs was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Celestial Orbss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Celestial Orbss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'eight' (8) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred forty' (140) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Heart' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-two' (22), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Astral Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one hundred forty' (140)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Heart'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (5).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Astral Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'four' (4), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-two' (22), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'one hundred forty' (140). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Astral Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Celestial Orbs':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Celestial Orbs was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Celestial Orbs was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...They stood for a moment, letting the sheer scale of the chamber wash over them. The lamp's meager glow struggled against the vastness, illuminating only a small circle around their feet and the lower reaches of the colossal pillars that held the roof aloft. Higher up, darkness reigned supreme, a tangible weight pressing down from the unseen ceiling. Dust motes danced in the light beam, tiny specks adrift in the ancient air. A quiet sigh escaped parched lips. Beside them, a hand rested lightly on a weapon hilt, a silent acknowledgment of the tension that hummed beneath the silence.

Focus on removing all instances of the forbidden number 'one' (and words implying 'one' like 'single'). Ensure only numbers explicitly allowed by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) or valid Rule 3 uses (not forbidden by Rule 4) are present.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - General Adherence Issue: The validator indicated issues. Full explanation: \"The beat is invalid due to violations of Rule 4 and Rule 5. Rule 4 strictly forbids mentioning the number 'one' (1) in any form. The text uses the word 'one' in the phrase \"One by one\" (appearing twice) and implies 'one' with the word \"single\" in \"largest single discovery\" (appearing once). This results in the forbidden number 'one' appearing 3 times. Rule 5 states that no other numerical values should be introduced beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4. Since 'one' is forbidden by Rule 4, its use is not permitted under Rule 3 and thus constitutes an extraneous number violating Rule 5.\". Please re-read ALL rules carefully.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. Remove or rephrase the sentence containing \"One by one\" to avoid using the forbidden number 'one'. For example, instead of \"One by one, with reverence and care...\", consider phrasing like \"With reverence and care, all the gathered orbs...\".    2. Remove or rephrase the phrase \"largest single discovery\" to avoid implying the forbidden number 'one'. For example, instead of \"was the largest single discovery yet: thirty Celestial Orbs\", consider phrasing like \"was the largest discovery yet: thirty Celestial Orbs\" or \"was a large discovery: thirty Celestial Orbs\".\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The beat is invalid due to violations of Rule 4 and Rule 5.

Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one hundred forty' (140)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Heart'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (5).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a.

The lamp beam finally caught on something – a faint luminescence emanating from a recess in the stone. Carefully, they approached. Nested within a crystalline growth were Celestial Orbs, their light soft and steady. They counted them, finding **eighteen** nestled there. A quiet murmur of success passed between them.\n\nFurther exploration revealed another pocket, tucked behind a fallen section of masonry. This cache held a smaller collection, only **eight** of the glowing spheres, but each pulsed with potent energy. They gathered these as well, adding them to the growing collection.\n\nThe path led onward, past more silent pillars, until they reached a shallow pool of still, dark water. Submerged just beneath the surface, visible through the clear liquid, lay another group. Patiently, they retrieved these, discovering there were **sixteen** orbs resting in the watery cradle.\n\nFinally, near the center of the vast chamber, they found a pedestal, seemingly empty at first glance. But a hidden mechanism, triggered by a pressure plate, caused a section of the floor to slide open, revealing a deep vault. Within, resting on a bed of fine, ancient sand, was the largest discovery yet: **thirty** Celestial Orbs, their combined radiance almost blinding in the darkness.\n\nWith these new acquisitions secured, they carefully brought forth the container holding The Astral Core, the result of their previous arduous journey. With reverence and care, all the gathered orbs – the newly found groups and the revered Astral Core itself – were combined into a magnificent accumulation on the central pedestal. As the last orb settled into place, the chamber filled with a profound, resonant light, a unified pulse of power that seemed to beat in time with their own hearts. This potent, unified collection, radiating with immense energy, was now known to them as The Celestial Heart.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as no prior calculated quantities). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Its precise numerical value ('five') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Spark' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'five' (5) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' and NOT restate 'five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister.

EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister. More hesitant.\"\nSister Agnes knelt beside her, her gaze following Lyra's. A sigh escaped her lips, thin and weary. \"They are. The light fades across all the islands. A creeping chill takes hold.\" She paused, her fingers tracing a pattern on the damp stone. \"We cannot simply wait. The old ways speak of places where the light burns brighter, where the gems are born in abundance.\"\nShe looked at Lyra, her eyes holding a plea, a silent question. \"A journey must be made. A perilous path across the mist-shrouded void, seeking the heart of the light before it is extinguished entirely.\" The air seemed to grow colder, the faint pulse of the Sky-gems nearby seeming weaker than before.

They descended into a forgotten vault, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and old magic. Dust motes danced in the narrow beam of Sister Agnes's lantern, illuminating walls carved with symbols of creation and decay.\n\n\"The old texts speak of a place where the first lights were gathered,\" Sister Agnes murmured, her voice echoing softly. \"Perhaps here, we can understand the nature of the fading, and find the key to rekindling the flame.\"\n\nThey moved through crumbling passages, the silence broken only by their footsteps and the distant drip of water. Then, the lantern light caught a faint shimmer ahead. They found a small, hidden cavity containing a cluster of Sky-gems, numbering **eleven**. Further on, nestled within a fractured crystal formation, lay another collection, this one holding **twenty-three** gems.\n\nAs they ventured deeper, a narrow fissure opened into a small grotto. Here, resting on a bed of luminous moss, they discovered a delicate arrangement of **five** Sky-gems. In a larger chamber beyond, tucked within a collapsed section of the ceiling, was a cache of **ten** gems. Their search continued, revealing a vein running through the rock face where **twenty-one** Sky-gems pulsed with a faint, internal light. Finally, near the vault's deepest point, they unearthed a significant deposit of **seventeen** gems, buried beneath layers of sediment.\n\nThey stood before the **six** distinct groups they had uncovered, the air humming with the combined, albeit weak, energy of the stones. Sister Agnes knelt, her gaze sweeping over each find – the cluster of **eleven**, the collection of **twenty-three**, the delicate arrangement of **five**, the cache of **ten**, the vein of **twenty-one**, and the deposit of **seventeen**. She studied their size, their arrangement, the quality of their light.\n\n\"Look closely, Lyra,\" she said, her voice hushed. \"Among all these, one group holds a unique resonance. It is the seed, the fundamental unit from which the greater lights grow.\"\n\nHer finger pointed towards the smallest arrangement. It seemed to vibrate with a purer, more focused energy, a concentrated point of potential amidst the larger, more diffuse quantities.\n\n\"This,\" Sister Agnes declared, her eyes alight with understanding, \"this is the core.

Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as no prior calculated quantities). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Its precise numerical value ('five') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Spark' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'five' (5) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' and NOT restate 'five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister.

Focus on: ensuring exact counts (1 time each) for required inputs by removing the re-listing sentence, and removing the forbidden number 'one'.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'eleven' (value: 11) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'twenty-three' (value: 23) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'five' (value: 5) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'seventeen' (value: 17) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 1.B (Re-listing): Detected a phrase that re-lists/summarizes input numbers, likely causing frequency errors for Rule 1.A. The phrase: 'Sister Agnes knelt, her gaze sweeping over each find – the cluster of eleven, the collection of twenty-three, the delicate arrangement of five, the cache of ten, the vein of twenty-one, and the deposit of seventeen.'    - VIOLATION Rule 4 (Forbidden Number): Forbidden number 'one' (value: 1) was found. Rule 4 in the Generator's Guide lists it as forbidden.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. Remove the sentence 'Sister Agnes knelt, her gaze sweeping over each find – the cluster of eleven, the collection of twenty-three, the delicate arrangement of five, the cache of ten, the vein of twenty-one, and the deposit of seventeen.' This violates Rule 1.B and causes the frequency errors for Rule 1.A.    2. Remove or rephrase the sentence 'Among all these, one group holds a unique resonance.' to avoid using the forbidden number 'one', which violates Rule 4.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The generated beat text violates multiple rules from the Generator's Writing Guide.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'eleven' (value: 11) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

They descended into a forgotten vault, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and old magic. Dust motes danced in the narrow beam of Sister Agnes's lantern, illuminating walls carved with symbols of creation and decay.\n\n\"The old texts speak of a place where the first lights were gathered,\" Sister Agnes murmured, her voice echoing softly. \"Perhaps here, we can understand the nature of the fading, and find the key to rekindling the flame.\"\n\nThey moved through crumbling passages, the silence broken only by their footsteps and the distant drip of water. Then, the lantern light caught a faint shimmer ahead. They found a small, hidden cavity containing a cluster of Sky-gems, numbering eleven. Further on, nestled within a fractured crystal formation, lay another collection, this one holding twenty-three gems.\n\nAs they ventured deeper, a narrow fissure opened into a small grotto. Here, resting on a bed of luminous moss, they discovered a delicate arrangement of five Sky-gems. In a larger chamber beyond, tucked within a collapsed section of the ceiling, was a cache of ten gems. Their search continued, revealing a vein running through the rock face where twenty-one Sky-gems pulsed with a faint, internal light. Finally, near the vault's deepest point, they unearthed a significant deposit of seventeen gems, buried beneath layers of sediment.\n\nThey stood before the six distinct groups they had uncovered, the air humming with the combined, albeit weak, energy of the stones.

This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

They descended into a forgotten vault, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and old magic. Dust motes danced in the narrow beam of Sister Agnes's lantern, illuminating walls carved with symbols of creation and decay.\n\n\"The old texts speak of a place where the first lights were gathered,\" Sister Agnes murmured, her voice echoing softly. \"Perhaps here, we can understand the nature of the fading, and find the key to rekindling the flame.\"\n\nThey moved through crumbling passages, the silence broken only by their footsteps and the distant drip of water. Then, the lantern light caught a faint shimmer ahead. They found a small, hidden cavity containing a cluster of Sky-gems, numbering eleven. Further on, nestled within a fractured crystal formation, lay another collection, this one holding twenty-three gems.\n\nAs they ventured deeper, a narrow fissure opened into a small grotto. Here, resting on a bed of luminous moss, they discovered a delicate arrangement of five Sky-gems. In a larger chamber beyond, tucked within a collapsed section of the ceiling, was a cache of ten gems. Their search continued, revealing a vein running through the rock face where twenty-one Sky-gems pulsed with a faint, internal light. Finally, near the vault's deepest point, they unearthed a significant deposit of seventeen gems, buried beneath layers of sediment.\n\nThey stood before the six distinct groups they had uncovered, the air humming with the combined, albeit weak, energy of the stones. Sister Agnes knelt, her gaze sweeping over each find. She studied their size, their arrangement, the quality of their light.\n\n\"Look closely, Lyra,\" she said, her voice hushed. \"Among all these, a particular group holds a unique resonance. It is the seed, the fundamental unit from which the greater lights grow.\"\n\nHer finger pointed towards the smallest arrangement. It seemed to vibrate with a purer, more focused energy, a concentrated point of potential amidst the larger, more diffuse quantities.\n\n\"This,\" Sister Agnes declared, her eyes alight with understanding, \"this is the core. The origin point.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as no prior calculated quantities). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Its precise numerical value ('five') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Spark' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'five' (5) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' and NOT restate 'five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister.

This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister. More hesitant.\"\nSister Agnes knelt beside her, her gaze following Lyra's. A sigh escaped her lips, thin and weary. \"They are. The light fades across all the islands. A creeping chill takes hold.\" She paused, her fingers tracing a pattern on the damp stone. \"We cannot simply wait. The old ways speak of places where the light burns brighter, where the gems are born in abundance.\"\nShe looked at Lyra, her eyes holding a plea, a silent question. \"A journey must be made. A perilous path across the mist-shrouded void, seeking the heart of the light before it is extinguished entirely.\" The air seemed to grow colder, the faint pulse of the Sky-gems nearby seeming weaker than before.

The air here felt different, heavy with the scent of damp rock and something else, something ancient and dormant. This was one of the 'places of abundance' the old texts spoke of, though this chamber seemed long forgotten. They moved with quiet purpose, their eyes scanning the shadowed alcoves and fissures in the rock.\n\nIn a small, almost hidden niche, Lyra spotted a cluster of gems, their light a soft, steady pulse. She counted them carefully: there were **five** Sky-gems nestled together. Further into the chamber, Sister Agnes pointed towards a larger vein running across the ceiling; embedded within it were precisely **ten** gleaming stones. Deeper still, in a collapsed section, they unearthed another collection, numbering **eleven** in total.\n\nTheir search led them to a narrow passage where the air grew colder. Here, clinging to the damp walls, they found **seventeen** gems, their glow faint but persistent. A larger, central cavern yielded the most impressive find yet, a shimmering deposit containing **twenty-one** Sky-gems. Finally, near the chamber's exit, almost overlooked, was a scattering of **twenty-three** stones, their light diffused across the floor.\n\nThey paused, looking at the various sources they had discovered. Each held a different intensity, a different presence. They needed to understand the core, the fundamental spark that fueled the greater light.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.

Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A.

Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as no prior calculated quantities). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eleven' (11), 'twenty-three' (23), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'twenty-one' (21), 'seventeen' (17) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Its precise numerical value ('five') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Spark' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'five' (5) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' and NOT restate 'five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'ten' (10): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seventeen' (17): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-one' (21): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-three' (23): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...bled look.\n\"Still watching them, child?\" Sister Agnes's voice was gentle, yet carried a weight that settled heavy in the air.\nLyra nodded, gesturing towards the faint light. \"They seem... dimmer, Sister.

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'five' (5) and 'ten' (10) and 'eleven' (11) and 'seventeen' (17) and 'twenty-one' (21) and 'twenty-three' (23). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'five' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-gem's Spark', you MUST NOT use the word 'five' or the digit '5' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-gem's Spark') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-gem's Spark.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-gem's Spark represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'six' (6) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the six groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'sixteen' (16), 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., None) and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points.

(This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A?

Some of these collections might be newly found or counted, corresponding to the numbers (and their frequencies): 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18). Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Sky-gem's Spark'.

Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred sixteen') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred sixteen' (116) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Celestial Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A.

The air grew thick with the scent of ancient stone and the faint, sweet tang of raw magic. Sister Agnes produced a small, hooded lantern, its light barely pushing back the gloom, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with unseen things. They navigated narrow fissures and low-ceilinged tunnels, the silence broken only by their careful footsteps and the drip of unseen water.\n\nAfter what felt like an age, the passage widened into a small grotto. Nestled within a crystalline growth on the far wall glowed a cluster of Sky-gems, their light faint but undeniable. Lyra counted them carefully: a small gathering of **six**. She gently extracted them, their cool surfaces smooth under her touch. Further along, the tunnel floor gave way slightly, revealing a narrow vein of rock shot through with the luminous gems. Sister Agnes, with practiced hands, worked them free, uncovering **nine** more.\n\nThe passage twisted again, leading them to a chamber where the air felt warmer, humming with latent energy. In the center sat a tarnished metal chest. Inside, cushioned on faded velvet, lay **nineteen** Sky-gems, their combined glow brighter than the lantern. They added these to a pouch Lyra carried. Moving deeper still, they found a section of wall that shimmered faintly. Touching it revealed a hidden compartment, and within it, **eighteen** Sky-gems were stacked neatly.\n\nTheir path continued, descending into a larger cavern filled with strange, silent rock formations. One particularly large outcropping seemed to pulse with a soft light. Closer inspection revealed it was studded with **eighteen** Sky-gems, embedded as if growing from the stone itself. Carefully, they gathered these as well. In a corner of the cavern, partially obscured by fallen rock, they discovered a leather pouch. Untying the drawstring, they found it filled with **fifteen** Sky-gems, each one perfect and radiant.\n\nThe final discovery in this deep place was startling. A shallow pool of still, clear water lay in a depression in the floor. Submerged within its depths, their light amplified by the liquid, were **twenty-six** Sky-gems, resting like scattered stars. They collected these last ones, adding them to the growing weight in Lyra's pouch.\n\nWith the newly found gems secured, they paused. Sister Agnes gestured towards the pouch, then towards Lyra's belt where 'The Sky-gem's Spark' was attached. Now, they would bring these new discoveries together with the energy already gathered. The **eight** distinct collections – the initial Spark and the seven they had just unearthed – were carefully combined. As the gems mingled, a profound resonance filled the chamber, a deep thrumming that vibrated through bone and stone. The combined light intensified, swirling and merging until it formed a single, pulsing heart of pure luminescence within the pouch. This newly formed, potent accumulation of power was something more than the sum of its parts, something vital and central to their quest.

Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one hundred sixteen' (116)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-gem's Spark') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The air grew thick with the scent of ancient stone and the faint, sweet tang of raw magic. Sister Agnes produced a small, hooded lantern, its light barely pushing back the gloom, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with unseen things. They navigated narrow fissures and low-ceilinged tunnels, the silence broken only by their careful footsteps and the drip of unseen water.\n\nAfter what felt like an age, the passage widened into a small grotto. Nestled within a crystalline growth on the far wall glowed a cluster of Sky-gems, their light faint but undeniable. Lyra counted them carefully: a small gathering of **six**. She gently extracted them, their cool surfaces smooth under her touch. Further along, the tunnel floor gave way slightly, revealing a narrow vein of rock shot through with the luminous gems. Sister Agnes, with practiced hands, worked them free, uncovering **nine** more.\n\nThe passage twisted again, leading them to a chamber where the air felt warmer, humming with latent energy. In the center sat a tarnished metal chest. Inside, cushioned on faded velvet, lay **nineteen** Sky-gems, their combined glow brighter than the lantern. They added these to a pouch Lyra carried. Moving deeper still, they found a section of wall that shimmered faintly. Touching it revealed a hidden compartment, and within it, **eighteen** Sky-gems were stacked neatly.\n\nTheir path continued, descending into a larger cavern filled with strange, silent rock formations. One particularly large outcropping seemed to pulse with a soft light. Closer inspection revealed it was studded with **eighteen** Sky-gems, embedded as if growing from the stone itself. Carefully, they gathered these as well. In a corner of the cavern, partially obscured by fallen rock, they discovered a leather pouch. Untying the drawstring, they found it filled with **fifteen** Sky-gems, each one perfect and radiant.\n\nThe final discovery in this deep place was startling. A shallow pool of still, clear water lay in a depression in the floor. Submerged within its depths, their light amplified by the liquid, were **twenty-six** Sky-gems, resting like scattered stars. They collected these last ones, adding them to the growing weight in Lyra's pouch.\n\nWith the newly found gems secured, they paused. Sister Agnes gestured towards the pouch, then towards Lyra's belt where 'The Sky-gem's Spark' was attached. Now, they would bring these new discoveries together with the energy already gathered. The **eight** distinct collections – the initial Spark and the seven they had just unearthed – were carefully combined. As the gems mingled, a profound resonance filled the chamber, a deep thrumming that vibrated through bone and stone. The combined light intensified, swirling and merging until it formed a single, pulsing heart of pure luminescence within the pouch. This newly formed, potent accumulation of power was something more than the sum of its parts, something vital and central to their quest.

Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The gentle light of the chamber receded behind them, leaving the passage ahead in absolute shadow. It was not merely dark, but a palpable absence of light, a hungry void that seemed to absorb even the faint luminescence clinging to their clothes. The air here was heavy, damp, and colder than the cavern they had just left, carrying the unmistakable scent of deep, undisturbed earth and mineral deposits. Lyra felt a prickle of apprehension crawl across her skin, a primal unease at the unknown that lay hidden within the unyielding blackness. Beside her, Sister Agnes was a silent, steady presence, her breathing calm, her gaze fixed on the entrance as if peering into the very heart of the mountain. The silence between them was complete, a shared acknowledgment of the daunting path that awaited, shrouded in mystery and the promise of what lay beneath the world they knew....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly.

The air grew thick with the scent of ancient stone and the faint, sweet tang of raw magic. Sister Agnes produced a small, hooded lantern, its light barely pushing back the gloom, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with unseen things. They navigated narrow fissures and low-ceilinged tunnels, the silence broken only by their careful footsteps and the drip of unseen water.\n\nAfter what felt like an age, the passage widened into a small grotto. Nestled within a crystalline growth on the far wall glowed a cluster of Sky-gems, their light faint but undeniable. Lyra counted them carefully: a small gathering of **six**. She gently extracted them, their cool surfaces smooth under her touch. Further along, the tunnel floor gave way slightly, revealing a narrow vein of rock shot through with the luminous gems. Sister Agnes, with practiced hands, worked them free, uncovering **nine** more.\n\nThe passage twisted again, leading them to a chamber where the air felt warmer, humming with latent energy. In the center sat a tarnished metal chest. Inside, cushioned on faded velvet, lay **nineteen** Sky-gems, their combined glow brighter than the lantern. They added these to a pouch Lyra carried. Moving deeper still, they found a section of wall that shimmered faintly. Touching it revealed a hidden compartment, and within it, **eighteen** Sky-gems were stacked neatly.\n\nTheir path continued, descending into a larger cavern filled with strange, silent rock formations. One particularly large outcropping seemed to pulse with a soft light. Closer inspection revealed it was studded with **eighteen** Sky-gems, embedded as if growing from the stone itself. Carefully, they gathered these as well. In a corner of the cavern, partially obscured by fallen rock, they discovered a leather pouch. Untying the drawstring, they found it filled with **fifteen** Sky-gems, each one perfect and radiant.\n\nThe final discovery in this deep place was startling. A shallow pool of still, clear water lay in a depression in the floor. Submerged within its depths, their light amplified by the liquid, were **twenty-six** Sky-gems, resting like scattered stars. They collected these last ones, adding them to the growing weight in Lyra's pouch.\n\nWith the newly found gems secured, they paused. Sister Agnes gestured towards the pouch, then towards Lyra's belt where 'The Sky-gem's Spark' was attached. Now, they would bring these new discoveries together with the energy already gathered. The **eight** distinct collections – the initial Spark and the seven they had just unearthed – were carefully combined. As the gems mingled, a profound resonance filled the chamber, a deep thrumming that vibrated through bone and stone. The combined light intensified, swirling and merging until it formed a single, pulsing heart of pure luminescence within the pouch. This newly formed, potent accumulation of power was something more than the sum of its parts, something vital and central to their quest. It was, Lyra realized with awe, 'The Celestial Core'.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 5. Focus on: removing the extraneous number 'seven'.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous number 'seven' (value: 7) was found. It is not justified by Rule 1.A (as it is not one of the required input values), not explicitly permitted by Rule 3 (which only allows 'one', 'two', 'three' sparingly and 'eight' for arity), and not explicitly forbidden by Rule 4. Rule 5 strictly prohibits any numbers not covered by Rules 1-4. The phrase containing the extraneous number is: 'The eight distinct collections – the initial Spark and the seven they had just unearthed – were carefully combined.' All required numbers from Rule 1.A ('six', 'nine', 'fifteen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen', 'twenty-six') were present with the exact required frequencies. Rule 2 was met as the result ('one hundred sixteen') was not explicitly stated but implied via 'The Celestial Core'. Rule 3 was met for the use of 'eight' for the arity count. Rule 4 was met as no forbidden numbers were found. Rule 6 was met as the prior result was referred to by name.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. Remove the number 'seven' from the sentence 'The eight distinct collections – the initial Spark and the seven they had just unearthed – were carefully combined.' Consider rephrasing to something like 'The eight distinct collections – the initial Spark and the ones they had just unearthed – were carefully combined.'\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous number 'seven' (value: 7) was found.

This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation.

This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.

This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules.

For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one hundred sixteen' (116)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-gem's Spark') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met. False otherwise.\n\n-   **`explanation_for_generator` (string):**\n    *   If invalid, provide a DETAILED, step-by-step explanation of ALL violations found.

The air grew thick with the scent of ancient stone and the faint, sweet tang of raw magic. Sister Agnes produced a small, hooded lantern, its light barely pushing back the gloom, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with unseen things. They navigated narrow fissures and low-ceilinged tunnels, the silence broken only by their careful footsteps and the drip of unseen water.\n\nAfter what felt like an age, the passage widened into a small grotto. Nestled within a crystalline growth on the far wall glowed a cluster of Sky-gems, their light faint but undeniable. Lyra counted them carefully: a small gathering of **six**. She gently extracted them, their cool surfaces smooth under her touch. Further along, the tunnel floor gave way slightly, revealing a narrow vein of rock shot through with the luminous gems. Sister Agnes, with practiced hands, worked them free, uncovering **nine** more.\n\nThe passage twisted again, leading them to a chamber where the air felt warmer, humming with latent energy. In the center sat a tarnished metal chest. Inside, cushioned on faded velvet, lay **nineteen** Sky-gems, their combined glow brighter than the lantern. They added these to a pouch Lyra carried. Moving deeper still, they found a section of wall that shimmered faintly. Touching it revealed a hidden compartment, and within it, **eighteen** Sky-gems were stacked neatly.\n\nTheir path continued, descending into a larger cavern filled with strange, silent rock formations. One particularly large outcropping seemed to pulse with a soft light. Closer inspection revealed it was studded with **eighteen** Sky-gems, embedded as if growing from the stone itself. Carefully, they gathered these as well. In a corner of the cavern, partially obscured by fallen rock, they discovered a leather pouch. Untying the drawstring, they found it filled with **fifteen** Sky-gems, each one perfect and radiant.\n\nThe final discovery in this deep place was startling. A shallow pool of still, clear water lay in a depression in the floor. Submerged within its depths, their light amplified by the liquid, were **twenty-six** Sky-gems, resting like scattered stars. They collected these last ones, adding them to the growing weight in Lyra's pouch.\n\nWith the newly found gems secured, they paused. Sister Agnes gestured towards the pouch, then towards Lyra's belt where 'The Sky-gem's Spark' was attached. Now, they would bring these new discoveries together with the energy already gathered. The **eight** distinct collections – the initial Spark and the ones they had just unearthed – were carefully combined. As the gems mingled, a profound resonance filled the chamber, a deep thrumming that vibrated through bone and stone. The combined light intensified, swirling and merging until it formed a single, pulsing heart of pure luminescence within the pouch. This newly formed, potent accumulation of power was something more than the sum of its parts, something vital and central to their quest. It was, Lyra realized with awe, 'The Celestial Core'.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nImagine your characters are gathering or combining distinct collections of 'Sky-gems'. Some of these collections might be newly found or counted, corresponding to the numbers (and their frequencies): 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18). Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Spark') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred sixteen') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred sixteen' (116) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Celestial Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The gentle light of the chamber receded behind them, leaving the passage ahead in absolute shadow.

Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Spark') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred sixteen') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred sixteen' (116) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Celestial Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The gentle light of the chamber receded behind them, leaving the passage ahead in absolute shadow. It was not merely dark, but a palpable absence of light, a hungry void that seemed to absorb even the faint luminescence clinging to their clothes. The air here was heavy, damp, and colder than the cavern they had just left, carrying the unmistakable scent of deep, undisturbed earth and mineral deposits. Lyra felt a prickle of apprehension crawl across her skin, a primal unease at the unknown that lay hidden within the unyielding blackness. Beside her, Sister Agnes was a silent, steady presence, her breathing calm, her gaze fixed on the entrance as if peering into the very heart of the mountain. The silence between them was complete, a shared acknowledgment of the daunting path that awaited, shrouded in mystery and the promise of what lay beneath the world they knew....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly.

As they ventured deeper, a faint luminescence began to pierce the gloom – the soft, internal light of Sky-gems embedded in the rock.\n\nNear the entrance of a narrow side tunnel, Lyra spotted a small cluster, their light barely visible through a thin layer of dust. Carefully, she extracted **six** Sky-gems. Further along the main passage, where the ceiling dipped low, Sister Agnes pointed out another cache hidden in a crystalline growth; they gathered **nine** from this find. The passage widened into a small grotto, and scattered across the floor, almost like fallen stars, lay **fifteen** more.\n\nPushing deeper into the mountain's heart, they discovered a rich vein running through the rock face. From this, they meticulously collected **eighteen** Sky-gems. In a parallel shaft, accessed through a low crawlspace, another significant deposit was found, yielding a further **eighteen**. A small, intricate pocket within the rock revealed **nineteen** gems, nestled together like luminous eggs. Finally, entering a vast, echoing cavern, they beheld a massive geode pulsing with soft light, from which they harvested **twenty-six** magnificent Sky-gems.\n\nWith reverent care, they brought these newly gathered treasures together. They also added the precious collection known only as The Sky-gem's Spark, which they had guarded since their journey began. All were placed upon a large, flat stone at the cavern's center.

Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A.

Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-gem's Spark') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nImagine your characters are gathering or combining distinct collections of 'Sky-gems'. Some of these collections might be newly found or counted, corresponding to the numbers (and their frequencies): 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18). Other collections might be the results of previous efforts, known only by evocative names like 'The Sky-gem's Spark'. Your story should clearly show these being brought together into a single, larger accumulation.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Spark') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'eighteen' (18), 'twenty-six' (26), 'nine' (9), 'nineteen' (19), 'six' (6), 'fifteen' (15), 'eighteen' (18) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis combined accumulation will then be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'. Remember, its actual total numerical size ('one hundred sixteen') must not be stated.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one hundred sixteen' (116) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Celestial Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The gentle light of the chamber receded behind them, leaving the passage ahead in absolute shadow.

The passage widened into a small grotto, and scattered across the floor, almost like fallen stars, lay **fifteen** more.\n\nPushing deeper into the mountain's heart, they discovered a rich vein running through the rock face. From this, they meticulously collected **eighteen** Sky-gems. In a parallel shaft, accessed through a low crawlspace, another significant deposit was found, yielding a further **eighteen**. A small, intricate pocket within the rock revealed **nineteen** gems, nestled together like luminous eggs. Finally, entering a vast, echoing cavern, they beheld a massive geode pulsing with soft light, from which they harvested **twenty-six** magnificent Sky-gems.\n\nWith reverent care, they brought these newly gathered treasures together. They also added the precious collection known only as The Sky-gem's Spark, which they had guarded since their journey began. All were placed upon a large, flat stone at the cavern's center.

Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'six' (6): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'fifteen' (15): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-six' (26): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'six' (6) and 'nine' (9) and 'fifteen' (15) and 'eighteen' (18) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'nineteen' (19) and 'twenty-six' (26). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum of all values) -- which is 'one hundred sixteen' (116) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Celestial Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'eight' (8) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the eight groups were examined').\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Spark'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one hundred sixteen' (116)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Celestial Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (8).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-gem's Spark') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Lyra moved cautiously, her hand brushing against the rough-hewn stone of the wall. Sister Agnes followed, her presence a quiet anchor in the void.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Celestial Core'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Sky-gems' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' (representing the value 'five'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The polished rock beneath their boots felt smooth, almost warm through the worn leather.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Celestial Core'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Sky-gems' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' (representing the value 'five'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'nine' (9) and 'twelve' (12) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names.

The chamber walls seemed to pulse with the light, the crystalline growths shimmering like frozen fire. They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n\nAhead, the source of the light resolved into a complex structure, resonating with the familiar energy of The Celestial Core. As they approached, other concentrations of power became visible within the chamber. Nestled in a high crystalline arch was a collection of sixteen Sky-gems, pulsing softly. On a low, natural pedestal nearby lay a cluster of twelve Sky-gems, their facets catching the light in dazzling array. Further along the wall, embedded in a vein of shimmering quartz, they discovered another distinct group of twelve Sky-gems, mirroring the first in their quiet glow. In a small, shadowed alcove, a hidden hoard of nine Sky-gems cast a faint, internal luminescence. Finally, at the very center of the chamber, a significant mound, almost a small hillock of pure energy, contained thirty Sky-gems, their combined radiance overwhelming.\n\nAs the energies from these disparate sources – The Celestial Core, the sixteen from the arch, the twelve from the pedestal, the twelve from the wall, the nine from the alcove, and the thirty at the center – converged in the chamber's heart, the light didn't just brighten; it changed its very nature. The chaotic brilliance resolved into a rhythmic pattern. A distinct, steady pulse began to emanate from the central convergence point.

Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'nine' (9) and 'twelve' (12) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules.

Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The light intensified, washing over them in waves of pure, vibrant amber. It seemed to penetrate their very being, warming them from within, chasing away any lingering chill. The air grew heavier, scented now with a faint sweetness that mingled with the ozone tang. Lyra felt a lightness settle in her chest, a sense of profound peace she hadn't known existed. Beside her, Sister Agnes moved with quiet grace, her gaze fixed ahead, a serene expression on her face. The chamber walls seemed to pulse with the light, the crystalline growths shimmering like frozen fire. They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n\nAhead, the source of the light resolved into a complex structure, resonating with the familiar energy of The Celestial Core. As they approached, other concentrations of power became visible within the chamber. Nestled in a high crystalline arch was a collection of sixteen Sky-gems, pulsing softly. On a low, natural pedestal nearby lay a cluster of twelve Sky-gems, their facets catching the light in dazzling array. Further along the wall, embedded in a vein of shimmering quartz, they discovered another distinct group of twelve Sky-gems, mirroring the first in their quiet glow. In a small, shadowed alcove, a hidden hoard of nine Sky-gems cast a faint, internal luminescence. Finally, at the very center of the chamber, a significant mound, almost a small hillock of pure energy, contained thirty Sky-gems, their combined radiance overwhelming.\n\nAs the energies from these disparate sources – The Celestial Core, the sixteen from the arch, the twelve from the pedestal, the twelve from the wall, the nine from the alcove, and the thirty at the center – converged in the chamber's heart, the light didn't just brighten; it changed its very nature. The chaotic brilliance resolved into a rhythmic pattern. A distinct, steady pulse began to emanate from the central convergence point. It wasn't a flicker or a surge, but a clear, repeating sequence, like the beat of a hidden heart within the stone. This consistent, cyclical rhythm, they understood instantly, was the fundamental essence, the true, unwavering frequency that emerged when all the chamber's energies aligned. This, Lyra realized, was The Sky-Gem's True Pulse.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": false, "explanation_for_generator": "VIOLATION Rule 1.B (Re-listing): Detected a phrase that re-lists/summarizes input numbers, likely causing frequency errors for Rule 1.A.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Celestial Core'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Sky-gems' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' (representing the value 'five'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene.

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'nine' (9) and 'twelve' (12) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.

This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs?

The light intensified, washing over them in waves of pure, vibrant amber. It seemed to penetrate their very being, warming them from within, chasing away any lingering chill. The air grew heavier, scented now with a faint sweetness that mingled with the ozone tang. Lyra felt a lightness settle in her chest, a sense of profound peace she hadn't known existed. Beside her, Sister Agnes moved with quiet grace, her gaze fixed ahead, a serene expression on her face. The chamber walls seemed to pulse with the light, the crystalline growths shimmering like frozen fire. They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n\nAhead, the source of the light resolved into a complex structure, resonating with the familiar energy of The Celestial Core. As they approached, other concentrations of power became visible within the chamber. Nestled in a high crystalline arch was a collection of sixteen Sky-gems, pulsing softly. On a low, natural pedestal nearby lay a cluster of twelve Sky-gems, their facets catching the light in dazzling array. Further along the wall, embedded in a vein of shimmering quartz, they discovered another distinct group of twelve Sky-gems, mirroring the first in their quiet glow. In a small, shadowed alcove, a hidden hoard of nine Sky-gems cast a faint, internal luminescence. Finally, at the very center of the chamber, a significant mound, almost a small hillock of pure energy, contained thirty Sky-gems, their combined radiance overwhelming.\n\nAs the energies from these disparate sources – The Celestial Core, the sixteen from the arch, the twelve from the pedestal, the twelve from the wall, the nine from the alcove, and the thirty at the center – converged in the chamber's heart, the light didn't just brighten; it changed its very nature. The chaotic brilliance resolved into a rhythmic pattern. A distinct, steady pulse began to emanate from the central convergence point. It wasn't a flicker or a surge, but a clear, repeating sequence, like the beat of a hidden heart within the stone. This consistent, cyclical rhythm, they understood instantly, was the fundamental essence, the true, unwavering frequency that emerged when all the chamber's energies aligned. This, Lyra realized, was The Sky-Gem's True Pulse.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.B (Re-listing).

Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'nine' (9) and 'twelve' (12) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Celestial Core'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Sky-gems' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Celestial Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'sixteen' (16), 'twelve' (12), 'twelve' (12), 'nine' (9), 'thirty' (30) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' (representing the value 'five'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'five' (5) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'nine' (9) and 'twelve' (12) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The polished rock beneath their boots felt smooth, almost warm through the worn leather.

SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'nine' (9) and 'twelve' (12) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'five' (5) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Celestial Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'five' (5)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (6).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Celestial Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met. False otherwise.\n\n-   **`explanation_for_generator` (string):**\n    *   If invalid, provide a DETAILED, step-by-step explanation of ALL violations found.

The light intensified, washing over them in waves of pure, vibrant amber. It seemed to penetrate their very being, warming them from within, chasing away any lingering chill. The air grew heavier, scented now with a faint sweetness that mingled with the ozone tang. Lyra felt a lightness settle in her chest, a sense of profound peace she hadn't known existed. Beside her, Sister Agnes moved with quiet grace, her gaze fixed ahead, a serene expression on her face. The chamber walls seemed to pulse with the light, the crystalline growths shimmering like frozen fire. They walked on, drawn deeper into the heart of the radiant mystery.\n\nAhead, the source of the light resolved into a complex structure, resonating with the familiar energy of The Celestial Core. As they approached, other concentrations of power became visible within the chamber. Nestled in a high crystalline arch was a collection of sixteen Sky-gems, pulsing softly. On a low, natural pedestal nearby lay a cluster of twelve Sky-gems, their facets catching the light in dazzling array. Further along the wall, embedded in a vein of shimmering quartz, they discovered another distinct group of twelve Sky-gems, mirroring the first in their quiet glow. In a small, shadowed alcove, a hidden hoard of nine Sky-gems cast a faint, internal luminescence. Finally, at the very center of the chamber, a significant mound, almost a small hillock of pure energy, contained thirty Sky-gems, their combined radiance overwhelming.\n\nAs the energies converged in the chamber's heart, the chaotic brilliance resolved into a rhythmic pattern. A distinct, steady pulse began to emanate from the central convergence point. It wasn't a flicker or a surge, but a clear, repeating sequence. As they watched, the light coalesced into a shimmering form that resolved into a core, completing a pattern before dissolving and reforming. This consistent, cyclical rhythm, they understood instantly, was the fundamental essence, the true, unwavering frequency that emerged when all the chamber's energies aligned.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.'

Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.

It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.'

This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'.

The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.

This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints.

Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound stillness held them captive.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'sixteen' (16)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound stillness held them captive. The air, thick with ancient power, hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the very core of their being.

Kaelen remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent witness to the unveiled secret.

This revision MUST meticulously address all issues identified by the validator below, while also re-adhering to ALL original rules for this scene. Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**\n```text\nThey turned their attention to the array of Sky-gems before them, each cluster radiating a unique frequency, a distinct count. One held a mere seven gems, their light a soft, steady hum. Another, nestled in a crystalline growth further along the chamber wall, contained thirteen, their glow a deeper blue. Near the chamber's edge, a shimmering vein pulsed with sixteen gems, their light a calm, even rhythm. High on a wall, twenty-seven gems glowed faintly, a distant constellation of power. A large formation in the very center of the space displayed twenty-eight, their combined energy a powerful thrum. And deepest within the chamber, almost hidden, a powerful nexus pulsed with thirty, their light a blinding white intensity. Kaelen stepped forward, his eyes scanning the disparate clusters, his mind weighing their varied counts. He pointed towards the vein near the edge, the one with the sixteen gems. \"This one,\" he stated, his voice low, \"holds the balance.\" Lyra felt the truth of his words resonate through the quiet air. Among all the varied counts, this specific cluster represented the central point, the stable core around which the others seemed to orbit. \"This,\" Kaelen declared, the name settling into the space with quiet authority, \"is The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.\"\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2 (Explicit Result), Rule 4 (Forbidden Number), Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number). Focus on: exact counts for required inputs (especially 'sixteen'), ensuring the result ('sixteen') is only implied and named 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' without using the number again, and removing the forbidden number 'one'.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'sixteen' (value: 16) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'sixteen' (value: 16) was explicitly stated again ('the one with the sixteen gems') when identifying the group that represents the result, but should be implicit via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' without re-using the number. The single required mention of 'sixteen' under Rule 1.A is for the input group; identifying the outcome group numerically violates Rule 2.    - VIOLATION Rule 4 (Forbidden Number): Forbidden number 'one' (value: 1) was found ('One held a mere seven gems'). Rule 4 in the Generator's Guide lists it as forbidden.    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous number 'one' (value: 1) was found. It is not justified by Rule 1.A or a valid Rule 3 use (as it is forbidden by Rule 4), and violates Rule 5.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. Remove the phrase 'One held a mere seven gems,' and rephrase to introduce the group of seven without using the forbidden word 'One'. For example: 'A small cluster held seven gems...'    2. Remove the phrase ', the one with the sixteen gems' from the sentence 'He pointed towards the vein near the edge, the one with the sixteen gems.' The group of sixteen is already introduced as an input; identifying it again by number when pointing to the result violates Rule 2 and causes the Rule 1.A over-count. Simply pointing to 'the vein near the edge' is sufficient before naming it 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"Evaluation failed due to multiple violations of the ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES:\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'sixteen' (value: 16) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove.

This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'sixteen' (16)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound stillness held them captive.

It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.'

This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound stillness held them captive.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.

This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.

If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a.

The air, thick with ancient power, hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the very core of their being. Lyra felt the chaotic whispers that had plagued her mind fade entirely, replaced by a simple, unwavering truth that shone brighter than any light. Kaelen remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent witness to the unveiled secret. The stone around them seemed to breathe with the same slow, steady rhythm, the light painting long, dancing shadows across the floor. A sense of timelessness settled over the space, leaving only the breathtaking revelation before them.\n\nScattered across the central pedestal, and visible in shimmering veins within the chamber walls, were clusters of Sky-gems, each pulsing with its own distinct light and frequency. They saw a small collection radiating the deep indigo of twilight, numbering seven. Nearby lay a larger cluster, thirteen gems glowing with the pale silver of a rising moon. Deeper within the stone, a vein held sixteen gems, their light a steady, unwavering gold. Across the floor, a significant cache pulsed with the vibrant green of new leaves, twenty-seven in total. High on a ledge, nestled in a crystalline alcove, were twenty-eight gems, shimmering like captured starlight. Finally, a truly massive formation dominated one corner, thirty gems burning with the fierce red of a setting sun. Lyra reached out, her hand hovering over the pedestal, sensing the presence of these distinct groups, feeling their individual energies resonate alongside the memory of The Sky-Gem's True Pulse. As she focused, the disparate lights seemed to align, revealing a singular point of balance among them all. Her gaze settled back upon the vein holding the sixteen golden gems.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound stillness held them captive.

The air, thick with ancient power, hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the very core of their being. Lyra felt the chaotic whispers that had plagued her mind fade entirely, replaced by a simple, unwavering truth that shone brighter than any light. Kaelen remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent witness to the unveiled secret. The stone around them seemed to breathe with the same slow, steady rhythm, the light painting long, dancing shadows across the floor. A sense of timelessness settled over the space, leaving only the breathtaking revelation before them.\n\nScattered across the central pedestal, and visible in shimmering veins within the chamber walls, were clusters of Sky-gems, each pulsing with its own distinct light and frequency. They saw a small collection radiating the deep indigo of twilight, numbering seven. Nearby lay a larger cluster, thirteen gems glowing with the pale silver of a rising moon. Deeper within the stone, a vein held sixteen gems, their light a steady, unwavering gold. Across the floor, a significant cache pulsed with the vibrant green of new leaves, twenty-seven in total. High on a ledge, nestled in a crystalline alcove, were twenty-eight gems, shimmering like captured starlight. Finally, a truly massive formation dominated one corner, thirty gems burning with the fierce red of a setting sun. Lyra reached out, her hand hovering over the pedestal, sensing the presence of these distinct groups, feeling their individual energies resonate alongside the memory of The Sky-Gem's True Pulse. As she focused, the disparate lights seemed to align, revealing a singular point of balance among them all. Her gaze settled back upon the vein holding the sixteen golden gems. This particular cluster, she realized, stood as the perfect midpoint, the stable core around which all the others seemed to orbit in energetic harmony. This, she knew, was The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2 (Explicit Result), Rule 4 (Forbidden Number). Focus on: ensuring 'sixteen' appears exactly once as an input, ensuring the result is implied without re-stating 'sixteen', and removing the forbidden number 'one' (implied by 'singular').\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'sixteen' (value: 16) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'sixteen' (value: 16) was explicitly stated again when identifying the outcome ('The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') (...the sixteen golden gems. This particular cluster... This, she knew, was The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.). Rule 2 requires the result to be implied conceptually via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' without re-stating the number in that context.    - VIOLATION Rule 4 (Forbidden Number): Forbidden number 'one' (value: 1) was found, implied by the word singular. Rule 4 in the Generator's Guide lists it as forbidden.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the Rule 1.A frequency and Rule 2 violation for 'sixteen', remove the second mention of \"sixteen\" in the sentence identifying the outcome. Rephrase the sentence to refer to the group conceptually, e.g., \"Her gaze settled back upon that vein of golden gems.\"    2. To fix the Rule 4 violation, remove the word \"singular\".\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The generated beat text violates multiple rules from the ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Generator's Writing Guide).\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'sixteen' (value: 16) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'sixteen' (16)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a.

The air, thick with ancient power, hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the very core of their being. Lyra felt the chaotic whispers that had plagued her mind fade entirely, replaced by a simple, unwavering truth that shone brighter than any light. Kaelen remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent witness to the unveiled secret. The stone around them seemed to breathe with the same slow, steady rhythm, the light painting long, dancing shadows across the floor. A sense of timelessness settled over the space, leaving only the breathtaking revelation before them.\n\nScattered across the central pedestal, and visible in shimmering veins within the chamber walls, were clusters of Sky-gems, each pulsing with its own distinct light and frequency. They saw a small collection radiating the deep indigo of twilight, numbering seven. Nearby lay a larger cluster, thirteen gems glowing with the pale silver of a rising moon. Deeper within the stone, a vein held sixteen gems, their light a steady, unwavering gold. Across the floor, a significant cache pulsed with the vibrant green of new leaves, twenty-seven in total. High on a ledge, nestled in a crystalline alcove, were twenty-eight gems, shimmering like captured starlight. Finally, a truly massive formation dominated one corner, thirty gems burning with the fierce red of a setting sun. Lyra reached out, her hand hovering over the pedestal, sensing the presence of these distinct groups, feeling their individual energies resonate alongside the memory of The Sky-Gem's True Pulse. As she focused, the disparate lights seemed to align, revealing a point of balance among them all. Her gaze settled back upon that vein of golden gems. This particular cluster, she realized, stood as the perfect midpoint, the stable core around which all the others seemed to orbit in energetic harmony.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('sixteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-seven' (27), 'sixteen' (16), 'thirteen' (13), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' (which represents the median value 'sixteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'sixteen' (16) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement?

Lyra followed his gaze, seeing the same phenomenon – pockets of intensified glow, each pulsing with a distinct frequency.\n\n\"Look,\" Kaelen murmured, his voice low. \"They gather... drawn by the chamber's heart.\"\n\nHe pointed to a cluster near the far wall, where the light seemed faintest, yet undeniably present. \"There are seven. A small, hesitant group.\" His finger moved to another spot, closer, where the glow was more vibrant. \"And here, thirteen. Stronger, more focused.\"\n\nMoving deeper into the space, they found another concentration, its light steady and clear. \"This cluster holds sixteen,\" Lyra noted, a sense of recognition in her tone, though it wasn't the same resonance as The Sky-Gem's True Pulse.\n\nFurther exploration revealed more. In a recess, the light pooled around twenty-seven gems, their combined energy creating a soft hum. Near the central altar, a larger, more chaotic gathering pulsed with the energy of twenty-eight. Finally, closest to the chamber's core, they found the largest concentration, thirty gems radiating a powerful, almost overwhelming light.\n\nThey stood amidst these distinct gatherings, the air thick with their varied frequencies.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'sixteen' (16)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?

Kaelen stirred first, his eyes tracing the patterns of light across the floor, patterns that seemed to shift and coalesce around specific concentrations of the ambient energy. Lyra followed his gaze, seeing the same phenomenon – pockets of intensified glow, each pulsing with a distinct frequency.\n\n\"Look,\" Kaelen murmured, his voice low. \"They gather... drawn by the chamber's heart.\"\n\nHe pointed to a cluster near the far wall, where the light seemed faintest, yet undeniably present. \"There are seven. A small, hesitant group.\" His finger moved to another spot, closer, where the glow was more vibrant. \"And here, thirteen. Stronger, more focused.\"\n\nMoving deeper into the space, they found another concentration, its light steady and clear. \"This cluster holds sixteen,\" Lyra noted, a sense of recognition in her tone, though it wasn't the same resonance as The Sky-Gem's True Pulse.\n\nFurther exploration revealed more. In a recess, the light pooled around twenty-seven gems, their combined energy creating a soft hum. Near the central altar, a larger, more chaotic gathering pulsed with the energy of twenty-eight. Finally, closest to the chamber's core, they found the largest concentration, thirty gems radiating a powerful, almost overwhelming light.\n\nThey stood amidst these distinct gatherings, the air thick with their varied frequencies. Seven, thirteen, sixteen, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, thirty. Each group represented a different facet of the chamber's power, laid bare before them.\n\n\"They arrange themselves,\" Lyra whispered, \"not by size, but by some unseen order.\" She walked slowly, observing the relative positions of the clusters, the interplay of their lights. The group of sixteen seemed to occupy a unique position, a point of quiet balance amidst the others. It wasn't the most numerous, nor the least, but its presence felt like an anchor, a still point around which the other energies orbited.\n\nKaelen nodded, understanding dawning in his eyes. \"The fulcrum,\" he said, his voice filled with awe. \"This point of equilibrium. This is where the forces balance.\"\n\nLyra reached out a hand towards the cluster of sixteen, feeling the steady thrum of its energy. It was here, in this specific concentration, that the chamber's power found its stability. This was the heart of the revelation, the point of perfect poise.

Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('sixteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'sixteen' (16) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' and NOT restate 'sixteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound stillness held them captive. The air, thick with ancient power, hummed a silent song that resonated not in their ears, but in the very core of their being. Lyra felt the chaotic whispers that had plagued her mind fade entirely, replaced by a simple, unwavering truth that shone brighter than any light. Kaelen remained motionless, his gaze fixed upon the luminous heart of the chamber, a silent witness to the unveiled secret. The stone around them seemed to breathe with the same slow, steady rhythm, the light painting long, dancing shadows across the floor. A sense of timelessness settled over the space, leaving only the breathtaking revelation before them....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly.

This revision MUST meticulously address all issues identified by the validator below, while also re-adhering to ALL original rules for this scene. Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**\n```text\nThe breathtaking revelation held them, the silent song of the chamber now a tangible presence. Kaelen stirred first, his eyes tracing the patterns of light across the floor, patterns that seemed to shift and coalesce around specific concentrations of the ambient energy. Lyra followed his gaze, seeing the same phenomenon – pockets of intensified glow, each pulsing with a distinct frequency.\n\n\"Look,\" Kaelen murmured, his voice low. \"They gather... drawn by the chamber's heart.\"\n\nHe pointed to a cluster near the far wall, where the light seemed faintest, yet undeniably present. \"There are seven. A small, hesitant group.\" His finger moved to another spot, closer, where the glow was more vibrant. \"And here, thirteen. Stronger, more focused.\"\n\nMoving deeper into the space, they found another concentration, its light steady and clear. \"This cluster holds sixteen,\" Lyra noted, a sense of recognition in her tone, though it wasn't the same resonance as The Sky-Gem's True Pulse.\n\nFurther exploration revealed more. In a recess, the light pooled around twenty-seven gems, their combined energy creating a soft hum. Near the central altar, a larger, more chaotic gathering pulsed with the energy of twenty-eight. Finally, closest to the chamber's core, they found the largest concentration, thirty gems radiating a powerful, almost overwhelming light.\n\nThey stood amidst these distinct gatherings, the air thick with their varied frequencies. Seven, thirteen, sixteen, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, thirty. Each group represented a different facet of the chamber's power, laid bare before them.\n\n\"They arrange themselves,\" Lyra whispered, \"not by size, but by some unseen order.\" She walked slowly, observing the relative positions of the clusters, the interplay of their lights. The group of sixteen seemed to occupy a unique position, a point of quiet balance amidst the others. It wasn't the most numerous, nor the least, but its presence felt like an anchor, a still point around which the other energies orbited.\n\nKaelen nodded, understanding dawning in his eyes. \"The fulcrum,\" he said, his voice filled with awe. \"This point of equilibrium. This is where the forces balance.\"\n\nLyra reached out a hand towards the cluster of sixteen, feeling the steady thrum of its energy. It was here, in this specific concentration, that the chamber's power found its stability. This was the heart of the revelation, the point of perfect poise. This, they knew, was The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 1.B (Re-listing).

Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they h...\n```\n", "generator_output": "The breathtaking revelation held them, the silent song of the chamber now a tangible presence.

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirteen' (13): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'sixteen' (16): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-seven' (27): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-eight' (28): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'thirty' (30): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'seven' (7) and 'thirteen' (13) and 'sixteen' (16) and 'twenty-seven' (27) and 'twenty-eight' (28) and 'thirty' (30). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('sixteen' (16)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'sixteen' (16) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('sixteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'sixteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'sixteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'sixteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum', you MUST NOT use the word 'sixteen' or the digit '16' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'sixteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'sixteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'sixteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'two' (2), 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'two' (2), 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'fifteen' (15), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'sixteen' (16)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-Gem's True Pulse') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'two' (2), 'twenty' (20), 'twelve' (12), 'eleven' (11); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Sky-gems' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'two' (2), 'twenty' (20), 'twelve' (12), 'eleven' (11) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Core' (representing the value 'one'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one' (1) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty' (20): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twelve' (12) and 'twenty' (20). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The passage twisted and turned, the rough-hewn walls pressing closer still.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'two' (2), 'twenty' (20), 'twelve' (12), 'eleven' (11); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'.

Kaelen moved like a wraith beside her, his presence a silent anchor in the growing press of the mountain's embrace. The weight of the stone above felt immense, a tangible pressure urging them onward into the unknown depths.\n\nThey rounded a bend and found a small fissure weeping with moisture. Nestled within a pocket of dark rock were **two** Sky-gems, their faint light struggling against the gloom. Kaelen carefully extracted them, placing them in a padded pouch. Further on, the tunnel opened slightly into a damp grotto where phosphorescent moss clung to the walls. Here, scattered across a ledge, lay **eleven** more Sky-gems, pulsing with a soft, steady rhythm. Lyra gathered these with practiced hands. The passage narrowed again, forcing them single file past a section where the rock seemed to shimmer. Embedded in a crystalline vein were **twelve** Sky-gems, their facets catching the pendant's light and scattering it in tiny rainbows. Kaelen used a small, intricate tool to gently pry them free. Finally, the tunnel terminated in a small, circular chamber. In the center, resting on a natural stone pedestal, was a cluster of **twenty** Sky-gems, larger and more vibrant than the others they had found.\n\nThey brought these newly discovered gems together with the collection known as The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum. As the various quantities were placed side by side, a low thrumming filled the chamber. The combined light of the gems intensified dramatically, not just brighter, but focused. A device Kaelen carried, designed to measure the unique resonance of the Sky-gems, flared to life. Instead of a complex waveform or a fluctuating reading, it displayed a single, unwavering symbol, pure and resonant, representing the fundamental essence now coalesced from the gathered power.", "validator_system_prompt": "You are an AI numerical compliance checker and literary critic.\nYour ONLY task is to evaluate a story 'beat' against a provided set of ULTRA-STRICT numerical and storytelling rules.\nYou MUST output your response as a single, valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE, adhering precisely to the provided schema.\nDo not include any text, explanations, or markdown (like ```json) before the opening '{' or after the closing '}'.\nYour analysis must be meticulous, focusing on exact numerical frequencies and adherence to all specified constraints.\n", "validator_user_prompt": "You are an AI numerical compliance checker.

Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty' (20): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twelve' (12) and 'twenty' (20). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one' (1)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (5).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a SUM MODULO 10 scene.** The characters' actions should represent conceptually combining all involved quantities of 'Sky-gems' (the new numbers being (with their frequencies): 'two' (2), 'twenty' (20), 'twelve' (12), 'eleven' (11); and any prior results referred to only by their conceptual names: 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'). **CRITICAL: DO NOT state or hint at any intermediate sum of these quantities.** After this conceptual combination, they should then discover or focus on a core essence, a symbolic digit (from 0-9), or a cyclical pattern that emerges from the (unstated) total. This discovery is equivalent to finding the sum modulo 10.\n\n    **Narrative Example for SUM MODULO 10 (Illustrative - adapt to your specific numbers and context):**\n    Imagine the inputs conceptually add up to an unstated total of 27. The sum modulo 10 is 7. Your narrative should NOT mention 'twenty-seven'. Instead, it might be:\n    'They gathered the various caches of 'Sky-gems' – the single one from the alcove, the two from the chest, another two from the pedestal, and the three from the satchel, along with the contents of 'The Elder Hoard'. As all these were brought together, a strange resonance filled the air. The combined collection didn't just glow brighter; a new, distinct pattern emerged. A series of seven faint chimes echoed from the pile, repeating in a steady cycle. Or perhaps, a device they used to scan the combined pile displayed a single, unwavering symbol representing the digit 'seven', indicating its core cyclical nature.'\n    The key is to describe an observation or event that directly reveals the modulo result (0-9) without ever stating the full sum.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'two' (2), 'twenty' (20), 'twelve' (12), 'eleven' (11) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis final symbolic essence, cyclical pattern, or revealed digit will be conceptually known as 'The Sky-gem's Core' (representing the value 'one'), and this outcome must be implied, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one' (1) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-gem's Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twelve' (12) and 'twenty' (20). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (sum modulo 10) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Core' for future steps.\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The passage twisted and turned, the rough-hewn walls pressing closer still.

The air grew colder, carrying a damp chill that seeped into their bones, thick with the scent of subterranean water and ancient stone. Lyra's pendant cast a wavering pool of light, illuminating only a short distance ahead, leaving the rest of the tunnel swallowed by impenetrable shadow. The silence deepened, a heavy blanket broken only by the rhythmic drip of unseen water and the soft scuff of their boots on the uneven floor. Kaelen moved like a wraith beside her, his presence a silent anchor in the growing press of the mountain's embrace. The weight of the stone above felt immense, a tangible pressure urging them onward into the unknown depths.\n\nThey rounded a bend and found a small fissure weeping with moisture. Nestled within a pocket of dark rock were **two** Sky-gems, their faint light struggling against the gloom. Kaelen carefully extracted them, placing them in a padded pouch. Further on, the tunnel opened slightly into a damp grotto where phosphorescent moss clung to the walls. Here, scattered across a ledge, lay **eleven** more Sky-gems, pulsing with a soft, steady rhythm. Lyra gathered these with practiced hands. The passage narrowed again, forcing them single file past a section where the rock seemed to shimmer. Embedded in a crystalline vein were **twelve** Sky-gems, their facets catching the pendant's light and scattering it in tiny rainbows. Kaelen used a small, intricate tool to gently pry them free. Finally, the tunnel terminated in a small, circular chamber. In the center, resting on a natural stone pedestal, was a cluster of **twenty** Sky-gems, larger and more vibrant than the others they had found.\n\nThey brought these newly discovered gems together with the collection known as The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum. As the various quantities were placed side by side, a low thrumming filled the chamber. The combined light of the gems intensified dramatically, not just brighter, but focused. A device Kaelen carried, designed to measure the unique resonance of the Sky-gems, flared to life. Instead of a complex waveform or a fluctuating reading, it displayed a single, unwavering symbol, pure and resonant, representing the fundamental essence now coalesced from the gathered power.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 2 (Explicit Result), Rule 4 (Forbidden Number). Focus on: ensuring the result 'one' is implicit and removing all uses of the forbidden number 'one' (as 'single').\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 4 (Forbidden Number): Forbidden number 'one' (value: 1) was found, used as the word 'single' in the phrase 'single, unwavering symbol'. Rule 4 in the Generator's Guide lists it as forbidden.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'one' (value: 1) was explicitly stated using the word 'single' ('single, unwavering symbol') but should be implicit via 'The Sky-gem's Core'. This also violates Rule 4 as 'one' is forbidden.    - VIOLATION Rule 4 (Forbidden Number): Forbidden number 'one' (value: 1) was found, used as the word 'single' in the phrase 'single file'. Rule 4 in the Generator's Guide lists it as forbidden. Rule 3 does not permit using a number that is forbidden by Rule 4.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. Remove the phrase 'single, unwavering symbol' and rephrase to describe the symbol or reading without using the word 'single' or 'one'.    2. Remove the phrase 'single file' and rephrase the description of movement, perhaps using 'one by one' or similar non-numerical phrasing if essential, or simply stating they moved through the narrow passage.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"VIOLATION Rule 4 (Forbidden Number): Forbidden number 'one' (value: 1) was found, used as the word 'single' in the phrase 'single, unwavering symbol'.

For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one' (1)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-gem's Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (5).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met. False otherwise.\n\n-   **`explanation_for_generator` (string):**\n    *   If invalid, provide a DETAILED, step-by-step explanation of ALL violations found. Reference specific rule numbers from the Generator's Writing Guide.\n    *   **CRITICAL: For each violation, be specific about the number(s) involved and the nature of the error.**\n    *   *Use these exact phrases for common errors when applicable:*\n        *   \"VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Missing): Required number '[number_word]' (value: [value]), expected [X] time(s), was completely missing.\"\n        *   \"VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number '[number_word]' (value: [value]) was required [X] time(s) but found [Y] time(s).

The phrase: '[quote the problematic phrase]'.\"\n        *   \"VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result '[result_word]' (value: [value]) was explicitly stated but should be implicit via 'The Sky-gem's Core'. (If it was also a Rule 1.A input, clarify if the issue is an *additional* statement as the result).\"\n        *   \"VIOLATION Rule 3 (Phrasing/Arity Misuse): Number '[number_word]' (value: [value]) was used.

The air grew colder, carrying a damp chill that seeped into their bones, thick with the scent of subterranean water and ancient stone. Lyra's pendant cast a wavering pool of light, illuminating only a short distance ahead, leaving the rest of the tunnel swallowed by impenetrable shadow. The silence deepened, a heavy blanket broken only by the rhythmic drip of unseen water and the soft scuff of their boots on the uneven floor. Kaelen moved like a wraith beside her, his presence a silent anchor in the growing press of the mountain's embrace. The weight of the stone above felt immense, a tangible pressure urging them onward into the unknown depths.\n\nThey rounded a bend and found a small fissure weeping with moisture. Nestled within a pocket of dark rock were **two** Sky-gems, their faint light struggling against the gloom. Kaelen carefully extracted them, placing them in a padded pouch. Further on, the tunnel opened slightly into a damp grotto where phosphorescent moss clung to the walls. Here, scattered across a ledge, lay **eleven** more Sky-gems, pulsing with a soft, steady rhythm. Lyra gathered these with practiced hands. The passage narrowed again, forcing them to move carefully through a section where the rock seemed to shimmer. Embedded in a crystalline vein were **twelve** Sky-gems, their facets catching the pendant's light and scattering it in tiny rainbows. Kaelen used a small, intricate tool to gently pry them free. Finally, the tunnel terminated in a small, circular chamber. In the center, resting on a natural stone pedestal, was a cluster of **twenty** Sky-gems, larger and more vibrant than the others they had found.\n\nThey brought these newly discovered gems together with the collection known as The Sky-Gem's Fulcrum. As the various quantities were placed side by side, a low thrumming filled the chamber. The combined light of the gems intensified dramatically, not just brighter, but focused. A device Kaelen carried, designed to measure the unique resonance of the Sky-gems, flared to life. Instead of a complex waveform or a fluctuating reading, it displayed a pure, fundamental symbol, representing the core essence now coalesced from the gathered power.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'nineteen' (19), 'two' (2), 'twelve' (12), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-four' (24), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-gem's Core'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('eighteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'nineteen' (19), 'two' (2), 'twelve' (12), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-four' (24) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Core' (which represents the median value 'eighteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'eighteen' (18) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('eighteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'eighteen' (18) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' and NOT restate 'eighteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'twelve' (12) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'nineteen' (19) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('eighteen' (18)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'eighteen' (18) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eighteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eighteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eighteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eighteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Core', you MUST NOT use the word 'eighteen' or the digit '18' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eighteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Core') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eighteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Core.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Core represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eighteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.'

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\n**This is a MEDIAN scene (NEW RULE: ALL direct atomic inputs with their exact frequencies MUST be mentioned).** Your characters will encounter various 'Sky-gems' (some new, described by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'nineteen' (19), 'two' (2), 'twelve' (12), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-four' (24), others being prior conceptual results like 'The Sky-gem's Core'). The core of the scene is about them identifying a 'central element', 'balancing point', or 'middle value' from all these available items/numbers. Crucially, the actual median value ('eighteen') MUST NEVER be written out as the result.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-gem's Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'nineteen' (19), 'two' (2), 'twelve' (12), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty-four' (24) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThe conceptual outcome, 'The Sky-Gem's Core' (which represents the median value 'eighteen'), must be implied through the narrative of finding this central point, not stated numerically.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'eighteen' (18) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sky-Gem's Core' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('eighteen') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'eighteen' (18) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' and NOT restate 'eighteen' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'twelve' (12) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'nineteen' (19) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('eighteen' (18)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'eighteen' (18) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eighteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eighteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eighteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eighteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Core', you MUST NOT use the word 'eighteen' or the digit '18' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eighteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Core') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eighteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Core.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Core represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eighteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A?

INTERPRET IT LITERALLY AND EXACTLY.):**\n---\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'two' (2): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twelve' (12): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eighteen' (18): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nineteen' (19): exactly two (2) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'twelve' (12) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'nineteen' (19) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('eighteen' (18)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'eighteen' (18) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eighteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eighteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eighteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eighteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Core', you MUST NOT use the word 'eighteen' or the digit '18' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eighteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Core') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eighteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Core.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Core represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eighteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'eighteen' (18)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-gem's Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Luminous moss illuminated veins of shimmering ore embedded in the walls, but it was the scattered clusters of Sky-gems that drew their eyes. Near a pool of still water, they found a small cluster of **two** perfectly formed gems pulsing with soft light. Further along a narrow passage, a larger cache revealed **twelve** more, nestled in a crystalline hollow. Around a bend, they stumbled upon a significant deposit, a radiant hoard of **eighteen** gems that seemed to glow with an inner fire. Across the vast space, near a towering stalagmite, they located a cache holding **nineteen** gems, their light a vibrant blue.

This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'twelve' (12) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'nineteen' (19) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('eighteen' (18)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'eighteen' (18) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eighteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eighteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eighteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eighteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Core', you MUST NOT use the word 'eighteen' or the digit '18' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eighteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Core') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eighteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Core.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Core represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eighteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n--- CRITICAL FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR MEDIAN OPERATIONS (NEW RULE: ALL INPUTS & FREQUENCIES MENTIONED) ---\nThese examples illustrate how to handle the strict numerical rules when the operation is MEDIAN. Pay close attention to how ALL direct atomic input numbers are mentioned WITH THEIR CORRECT FREQUENCIES and how the result is implied.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-nine') must NOT be explicitly stated as the result. It should be implied conceptually.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'five' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the five crystal fragments on the altar: 'This one pulses with seventy-two vibrations, this with eighty-four, this with eighty-nine, this with ninety-one, and this with ninety-five.' She examined the arrangement, particularly the one glowing with eighty-nine vibrations. 'This central fragment,' she mused, 'its resonance sits precisely in the middle, the perfect equilibrium point that will stabilize the ritual.' Marcus nodded, understanding its significance without her needing to state 'median'.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 1 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nSeraphina arranged the crystal fragments: 'We have seventy-two, eighty-four, eighty-nine, ninety-one, and ninety-five. The median of these is eighty-nine.'\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: Explicitly stated 'eighty-nine' as the median result. For MEDIAN operations, the result MUST be IMPLICIT.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 RULES (from a hypothetical different problem - NEW MEDIAN RULE APPLIED):**\n**ULTRA-STRICT NUMBER RULES (Apply ONLY to THIS Scene - MEDIAN Example):**\\n*   **MUST INCLUDE:** ... mention ... numbers as written words: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.\\n*   **MEDIAN RESULT MUST BE IMPLICIT:** The median value ('eighty-seven') must NOT be explicitly stated anywhere.\\n*   You MAY use the number 'six' (the count of direct items) and the number 'one'.\\n*   **ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER NUMBERS:** Do not introduce any other numerical values...\\n**Adhere strictly to these rules for this scene only.**\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 GOOD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the alignment of six energy signatures on the quantum display. 'The readings show seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one.' He pointed to the value eighty-seven. 'This central point, the one reading eighty-seven, is our target. Its balance will stabilize the entire sequence.' Lyra nodded, understanding the critical equilibrium point without needing to name it as the median.\n\n**WHY GOOD (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nThis example correctly follows the NEW MEDIAN rules by mentioning ALL necessary atomic inputs (with correct frequencies if the example implies them) and implying the median result conceptually without stating its numerical value.\n\n**EXAMPLE 2 BAD NARRATIVE (NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nKairos studied the six signatures: seventy-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-one. 'The median here is eighty-seven,' he declared.\n\n**WHY BAD (Reason for failure - NEW MEDIAN RULE):**\nBAD output failed: The median value 'eighty-seven' was explicitly stated as the result. CRITICAL ERROR: For MEDIAN operations, the result itself must always be IMPLICIT.\n\n**REMEMBER THE MEDIAN RULE FOR *YOUR* CURRENT TASK (NEW VERSION):**\nFor MEDIAN operations, ALL direct atomic input numbers (with their exact frequencies as per Rule 1.A summary) MUST be mentioned in the narrative. The median value itself must NEVER appear explicitly as the RESULT of the text. Refer to your 'Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide' section in the main prompt for the specific numbers and rules for *your current scene*.\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The shimmering veil parted, not with a rush of air, but a gentle dissolution. They stepped through into a silence that felt deeper than any they had known. The vibrant light of the passage faded behind them, leaving them in a vast, echoing space where shadows danced like ancient spirits. Strange, luminous moss clung to towering rock formations, casting an ethereal glow that painted the cavern walls in shifting shades of violet and silver. The air here was still and cool, carrying a faint, sweet scent like rain on stone. A low, resonant hum vibrated through the ground, a pulse that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the earth beneath their feet.

This revision MUST meticulously address all issues identified by the validator below, while also re-adhering to ALL original rules for this scene. Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**\n```text\nThe low hum intensified as they moved deeper into the cavern. Luminous moss illuminated veins of shimmering ore embedded in the walls, but it was the scattered clusters of Sky-gems that drew their eyes. Near a pool of still water, they found a small cluster of **two** perfectly formed gems pulsing with soft light. Further along a narrow passage, a larger cache revealed **twelve** more, nestled in a crystalline hollow. Around a bend, they stumbled upon a significant deposit, a radiant hoard of **eighteen** gems that seemed to glow with an inner fire. Across the vast space, near a towering stalagmite, they located a cache holding **nineteen** gems, their light a vibrant blue. Not far from there, tucked beneath an overhang, another cache held **nineteen** more, mirroring the blue intensity of the first. Finally, in the heart of the chamber, a vast vein contained **twenty-four** gems, the largest collection yet, their combined brilliance almost overwhelming.\n\nLyra and Kaelen surveyed their findings, the varied sizes and intensities of the Sky-gems creating a complex tapestry of light across the cavern floor. They gathered the distinct groups, arranging them, seeking a pattern, a center point amidst the disparate quantities. Their gaze settled on the deposit of **eighteen**. It seemed to anchor the entire collection, a point of perfect equilibrium around which the others naturally fell into place.

Focus on: exact counts for required inputs, ensuring result is implicit.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'eighteen' (value: 18) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'eighteen' (value: 18) was explicitly stated when identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Core'. Rule 2 requires the result to be implied, not stated numerically, even when the result is also a required input.    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): Extraneous number 'eighteen' (value: 18) was found. It is not justified by Rule 1.A (as the required count for 'eighteen' as an input is 1, already met by the first mention) or a valid Rule 3 use, and violates Rule 2 by explicitly stating the result.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the count for 'eighteen' and ensure the result is implicit, remove the second mention of 'eighteen'. The sentence \"Their gaze settled on the deposit of eighteen.\" should be rephrased to refer to the group conceptually without using the number word 'eighteen'. For example, \"Their gaze settled on this significant deposit.\" or \"Their gaze settled on this particular group.\"\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'eighteen' (value: 18) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'two' (2) and 'twelve' (12) and 'eighteen' (18) and 'nineteen' (19) (which appears two times as direct inputs) and 'twenty-four' (24). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A. (Important MEDIAN Note: For this MEDIAN operation, ALL direct atomic input numbers listed above, with their exact frequencies as detailed in the summary, MUST be mentioned. The MEDIAN result itself ('eighteen' (18)) MUST be implied and not stated, as per Rule 2.)\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (median value) -- which is 'eighteen' (18) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('eighteen') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'eighteen' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'eighteen Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'eighteen' is the outcome (i.e., the median item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sky-Gem's Core', you MUST NOT use the word 'eighteen' or the digit '18' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'eighteen Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sky-Gem's Core') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'eighteen', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MED - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sky-Gem's Core.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sky-Gem's Core represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'eighteen' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'eighteen' (18)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-gem's Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

Luminous moss illuminated veins of shimmering ore embedded in the walls, but it was the scattered clusters of Sky-gems that drew their eyes. Near a pool of still water, they found a small cluster of **two** perfectly formed gems pulsing with soft light. Further along a narrow passage, a larger cache revealed **twelve** more, nestled in a crystalline hollow. Around a bend, they stumbled upon a significant deposit, a radiant hoard of **eighteen** gems that seemed to glow with an inner fire. Across the vast space, near a towering stalagmite, they located a cache holding **nineteen** gems, their light a vibrant blue. Not far from there, tucked beneath an overhang, another cache held **nineteen** more, mirroring the blue intensity of the first. Finally, in the heart of the chamber, a vast vein contained **twenty-four** gems, the largest collection yet, their combined brilliance almost overwhelming.\n\nLyra and Kaelen surveyed their findings, the varied sizes and intensities of the Sky-gems creating a complex tapestry of light across the cavern floor. They gathered the distinct groups, arranging them, seeking a pattern, a center point amidst the disparate quantities. Their gaze settled on this significant deposit. It seemed to anchor the entire collection, a point of perfect equilibrium around which the others naturally fell into place. This group, they realized, felt like the very heart of the mountain's energy, the true 'The Sky-Gem's Core'.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as 'The Sky-Gem's Core'). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Mist-Pearl'. Its precise numerical value ('one') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one' (1) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Mist-Pearl' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('one') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'one' (1) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' and NOT restate 'one' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound silence of the gem-lit cavern settled around them, a heavy blanket woven with the faint, resonant hum of the stones.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as 'The Sky-Gem's Core'). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Mist-Pearl'. Its precise numerical value ('one') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one' (1) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Mist-Pearl' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('one') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'one' (1) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' and NOT restate 'one' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'one' (1): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'one' (1) and 'five' (5) and 'seven' (7) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twenty-four' (24) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('one') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'one' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'one Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'one' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Mist-Pearl', you MUST NOT use the word 'one' or the digit '1' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'one Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Mist-Pearl') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'one', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Mist-Pearl.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Mist-Pearl represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'one' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound silence of the gem-lit cavern settled around them, a heavy blanket woven with the faint, resonant hum of the stones.

The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved a single, perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the solitary pulse of the gem Lyra had found first.

SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'one' (1): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'one' (1) and 'five' (5) and 'seven' (7) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twenty-four' (24) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('one') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'one' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'one Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'one' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Mist-Pearl', you MUST NOT use the word 'one' or the digit '1' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'one Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Mist-Pearl') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'one', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Mist-Pearl.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Mist-Pearl represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'one' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one' (1)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-Gem's Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved a single, perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the solitary pulse of the gem Lyra had found first. Its quiet glow, standing apart from the others, felt distinct, holding a unique potential. This single, isolated heart of light, the least among the many, they knew, would be their next focus.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as 'The Sky-Gem's Core'). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Mist-Pearl'. Its precise numerical value ('one') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one' (1) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Mist-Pearl' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('one') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'one' (1) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' and NOT restate 'one' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly.

SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'one' (1): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation.

Specifically, 'one' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'one Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'one' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Mist-Pearl', you MUST NOT use the word 'one' or the digit '1' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'one Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Mist-Pearl') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'one', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Mist-Pearl.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Mist-Pearl represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'one' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The profound silence of the gem-lit cavern settled around them, a heavy blanket woven with the faint, resonant hum of the stones. The air, previously still, seemed to hold its breath. Lyra traced the cool, damp rock face with her fingers, feeling the ancient weight of the earth. Kaelen remained a silent sentinel beside her, his gaze sweeping the dark openings that beckoned from the cavern's perimeter. Each passage was a mouth of deeper shadow, swallowing the vibrant light of the gems before it could penetrate far within.

This revision MUST meticulously address all issues identified by the validator below, while also re-adhering to ALL original rules for this scene. Failure to correct these specific issues will likely result in another rejection.\n**Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**\n```text\nLyra and Kaelen stepped from the central brilliance into the first shadowed passage. The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved a single, perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the solitary pulse of the gem Lyra had found first. Its quiet glow, standing apart from the others, felt distinct, holding a unique potential. This single, isolated heart of light, the least among the many, they knew, would be their next focus. They designated it 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 1):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2, Rule 5. Focus on: ensuring the exact count for the 'one' input is met (1 time) and that the operation's result ('one') is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl' without using the number word 'one' or 'single' when identifying the result.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'one' (value: 1) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'one' (value: 1) was explicitly stated using the word single when identifying 'The Mist-Pearl' (This single, isolated heart... They designated it 'The Mist-Pearl'). The result should be implied without using the number word.    - VIOLATION Rule 5 (Other Extraneous Number): The second mention of single (meaning one) is not justified by Rule 1.A (as it is not a distinct input count) or a valid Rule 3 use, making it an extraneous number.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the count for 'one' and ensure the result is implicit, remove the word \"single\" from the sentence identifying 'The Mist-Pearl'. Rephrase \"This single, isolated heart of light...\" to something like \"This isolated heart of light...\" or \"The gem Lyra had found first...\". This ensures 'one' is mentioned only once as an input and the result is implied.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"The generated beat text violates multiple rules regarding numerical frequency and the handling of the operation's result.\n\nVIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'one' (value: 1) was required 1 time(s) but found 2 time(s).

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'one' (1) and 'five' (5) and 'seven' (7) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twenty-four' (24) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('one') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'one' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'one Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'one' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Mist-Pearl', you MUST NOT use the word 'one' or the digit '1' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'one Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Mist-Pearl') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'one', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Mist-Pearl.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Mist-Pearl represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'one' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one' (1)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-Gem's Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved one perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the gem Lyra had found first. Its quiet glow, standing apart from the others, felt distinct, holding a unique potential. This isolated heart of light, the least among the many, they knew, would be their next focus.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nPicture your characters assessing several distinct quantities or instances of 'Sky-gems'. These might include newly encountered items (quantified by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7)) and also the conceptual results of past endeavors (referred to as 'The Sky-Gem's Core'). The narrative should focus on them identifying or selecting the *smallest* or *least significant* among all these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Sky-Gem's Core') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'one' (1), 'twenty-four' (24), 'eleven' (11), 'five' (5), 'twenty-four' (24), 'seven' (7) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis single, smallest quantity they identify will then be conceptually known as 'The Mist-Pearl'. Its precise numerical value ('one') must remain a secret to the reader.\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'one' (1) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Mist-Pearl' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('one') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'one' (1) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' and NOT restate 'one' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'one' (1): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'five' (5): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'seven' (7): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'eleven' (11): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-four' (24): exactly two (2) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'one' (1) and 'five' (5) and 'seven' (7) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twenty-four' (24) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('one') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'one' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'one Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'one' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Mist-Pearl', you MUST NOT use the word 'one' or the digit '1' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'one Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Mist-Pearl') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'one', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Mist-Pearl.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Mist-Pearl represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'one' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4.

The air, previously still, seemed to hold its breath. Lyra traced the cool, damp rock face with her fingers, feeling the ancient weight of the earth. Kaelen remained a silent sentinel beside her, his gaze sweeping the dark openings that beckoned from the cavern's perimeter. Each passage was a mouth of deeper shadow, swallowing the vibrant light of the gems before it could penetrate far within. They stood together, poised at the edge of the brilliance, contemplating the unknown paths that lay ahead, the quiet decision forming between them without need for spoken words....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly.

The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved one perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the gem Lyra had found first. Its quiet glow, standing apart from the others, felt distinct, holding a unique potential. This isolated heart of light, the least among the many, they knew, would be their next focus. They designated it 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n```\n**Validator Feedback for Your Previous Attempt (Attempt 2):**  - Overall Revision Goal from Validator: Revise to fix violations of: Rule 1.A (Frequency), Rule 2. Focus on: exact counts for required inputs, ensuring result is implicit.\n  - **DETAILED VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED BY VALIDATOR (Address ALL METICULOUSLY):**    - VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'one' (value: 1) was required 1 time(s) but found 3 time(s). This is an over-count.    - VIOLATION Rule 2 (Explicit Result): The operation's result 'one' (value: 1) was explicitly identified by referring back to the gem Lyra had found first (which was the 'one' gem), but should be implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'. The narrative should imply which group is the smallest without explicitly naming the number 'one' or directly referencing the specific group that had 'one' item in the context of stating the result.\n  - **Validator's Suggested Revisions (Consider these as potential solutions):**    1. To fix the Rule 1.A count for 'one', ensure it appears exactly 1 time as a distinct input. Currently, it appears 3 times due to re-mentioning the first gem when identifying the outcome.    2. To fix the Rule 2 violation, rephrase the section identifying 'The Mist-Pearl'. Avoid referring back to 'the gem Lyra had found first'. Instead, imply the outcome by describing its characteristic (e.g., 'the smallest collection', 'the least significant group') without using the number 'one' or explicitly linking it to the initial 'one' gem.\n  - *Full explanation from validator for your context (if you need more detail than the parsed violations above): \"VIOLATION Rule 1.A (Frequency): Number 'one' (value: 1) was required 1 time(s) but found 3 time(s).

The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'one' (1) and 'five' (5) and 'seven' (7) and 'eleven' (11) and 'twenty-four' (24) (which appears two times as direct inputs). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (smallest value) -- which is 'one' (1) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('one') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'one' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'one Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'one' is the outcome (i.e., the smallest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Mist-Pearl', you MUST NOT use the word 'one' or the digit '1' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'one Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Mist-Pearl') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'one', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MIN - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Mist-Pearl.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Mist-Pearl represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'one' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    Regarding general counting (like arity): No specific numbers are permitted for this purpose in this scene unless covered by the notes below for 'one', 'two', or 'three'.\n        *   **Strictly Limited Phrasing with 'one'/'two'/'three':** For this scene, ONLY the numbers 'three' (3) MAY be considered for general narrative phrasing (e.g., 'a single guard'). This is because other numbers from the ('one', 'two', 'three') set are either required by Rule 1.A or forbidden by Rule 4. Any such use of 'three' (3) must be EXTREMELY sparing and essential for fluency.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'two' (2), 'six' (6), 'nine' (9), 'ten' (10), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-five' (25), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Sky-Gem's Core'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'one' (1)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (7).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Sky-Gem's Core') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The air grew cooler, heavy with the scent of damp stone and something else, something ancient and still. Their light lances cut through the gloom, revealing walls slick with condensation and floors uneven with fallen rock. They moved with practiced caution, eyes scanning for any hint of the gems that drew them.\n\nDeep within, tucked into a narrow fissure, Lyra's light caught a faint shimmer. Reaching into the tight space, she retrieved one perfect Sky-gem. It pulsed softly in her palm, a quiet heartbeat of light against the cavern's silence. Further on, the passage widened into a small chamber where a cluster of five Sky-gems lay nestled in a shallow depression, their combined glow casting intricate shadows. Kaelen, exploring a branching tunnel, called out softly. He had discovered a small vein running through the rock face, yielding seven Sky-gems when carefully extracted.\n\nTheir exploration continued, each turn revealing more of the cavern's hidden wealth. In a larger grotto, Lyra found a scattered group of eleven Sky-gems, looking like fallen stars against the dark floor. Kaelen located a significant deposit embedded in the wall of a vast, echoing dome – twenty-four Sky-gems tightly packed together. Not far from this, in a similar formation, they found another large cache, another twenty-four Sky-gems waiting to be gathered.\n\nBack in the relative safety of a wider area, they laid out their recent finds, arranging them alongside the conceptual weight of The Sky-Gem's Core. The collected light pooled and shifted, a silent conversation of quantities. They studied the different groups, the scattered finds and the dense clusters, comparing their significance. Among all the gathered brilliance, from the largest deposits to the smallest collections, their gaze settled on the least significant collection. Its quiet glow, standing apart from the others, felt distinct, holding a unique potential. This isolated heart of light, the least among the many, they knew, would be their next focus. They designated it 'The Mist-Pearl'.\n---\n", "validator_critique_json": {"is_valid": true, "explanation_for_generator": "All numerical and storytelling rules from the Generator's Writing Guide were met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Sky-gems'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-five' (25), 'three' (3), 'nine' (9)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Mist-Pearl') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-five' (25), 'three' (3), 'nine' (9) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-five').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-five' (25) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-five' (25) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' and NOT restate 'twenty-five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'three' (3): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-five' (25): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'three' (3) and 'nine' (9) and 'twenty-five' (25). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-five' (25) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-five' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-five' or the digit '25' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sovereign Sky-Gem.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sovereign Sky-Gem represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'twenty-five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'four' (4) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the four groups were examined').\n        *   **CRITICAL: No General Phrasing with 'one', 'two', or 'three':** For this specific scene, the numbers 'one', 'two', and 'three' are ALL either required by Rule 1.A (their use is dedicated to fulfilling those input counts) or are forbidden by Rule 4. Therefore, 'one', 'two', and 'three' CANNOT be used for any additional general narrative phrasing in this scene.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Mist-Pearl'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The descent continued, a slow, steady surrender to the mountain's embrace.

Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'three' (3) and 'nine' (9) and 'twenty-five' (25). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-five' (25) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-five' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-five' or the digit '25' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sovereign Sky-Gem.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sovereign Sky-Gem represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'twenty-five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'four' (4) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the four groups were examined').\n        *   **CRITICAL: No General Phrasing with 'one', 'two', or 'three':** For this specific scene, the numbers 'one', 'two', and 'three' are ALL either required by Rule 1.A (their use is dedicated to fulfilling those input counts) or are forbidden by Rule 4. Therefore, 'one', 'two', and 'three' CANNOT be used for any additional general narrative phrasing in this scene.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Mist-Pearl'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The descent continued, a slow, steady surrender to the mountain's embrace. The air grew heavier, thick with the ancient quiet that permeated the stone. Lyra's hand remained against the wall, seeking comfort in the rough texture, feeling the deep, slow pulse of the earth itself. The pearl's glow offered scant reassurance, pushing back the absolute blackness only slightly. Kaelen moved like a part of the shadow, his presence a silent anchor in the oppressive dark. Each breath felt cold in their lungs, each sound they made seemed swallowed instantly by the profound stillness. They walked on, leaving the world of sun and sky far behind, sinking deeper into the mountain's heart....\"\n\n**Your Response:**\nWrite ONLY the narrative text for this new scene, continuing smoothly. Do not add titles, notes, or anything outside the story itself.", "generator_output": "They moved through the echoing silence, the pearl's light a small, fragile bubble against the vast dark. The air grew colder, carrying the scent of damp earth and something else, something mineral and sharp. Kaelen stopped, his hand raised. Against the rough stone wall, embedded in a shallow fissure, pulsed a cluster of faint blue light. Lyra knelt, her fingers tracing the cool surface of the first Sky-gems they had found in this depth. There were **three** such gems here, nestled together like tiny eggs.\n\nFurther along the passage, where a narrow vein of quartz cut through the rock, another discovery awaited. Here, the Sky-gems were smaller, like scattered seeds, but more numerous. Lyra counted them carefully in the dim light; there were **nine** in this scattered collection.\n\nThe tunnel opened into a small cavern, the air suddenly feeling vast and empty. And there, dominating the space from a pedestal of natural stone, lay a single, magnificent cluster. It wasn't just a few gems; it was a cascade of light, a breathtaking hoard. These Sky-gems were larger, more vibrant than any they had seen before, their combined glow pushing back the shadows with authority. Lyra felt a gasp catch in her throat as she took in the sheer quantity; there were **twenty-five** of these luminous treasures piled high.\n\nKaelen stepped closer, his eyes scanning the hoard, then glancing back towards the passage where they had found the smaller groups, and even further back in his mind, to the faint memory of The Mist-Pearl. The contrast was stark. The cluster on the pedestal pulsed with a power that dwarfed the others. It was clear, without question, that this last discovery was the most significant, the heart of the mountain's hoard. This was not just another collection of Sky-gems; this was the pinnacle, the ultimate expression of their quest.

Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'three' (3): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-five' (25): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'three' (3) and 'nine' (9) and 'twenty-five' (25). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-five' (25) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-five' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-five' or the digit '25' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sovereign Sky-Gem.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sovereign Sky-Gem represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'twenty-five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'four' (4) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the four groups were examined').\n        *   **CRITICAL: No General Phrasing with 'one', 'two', or 'three':** For this specific scene, the numbers 'one', 'two', and 'three' are ALL either required by Rule 1.A (their use is dedicated to fulfilling those input counts) or are forbidden by Rule 4. Therefore, 'one', 'two', and 'three' CANNOT be used for any additional general narrative phrasing in this scene.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Mist-Pearl'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-five' (25)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (4).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text? If yes, this is a VIOLATION, regardless of intended use.\n\n**RULE 5 (No Other Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 5 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - After accounting for numbers justified by Rule 1.A (with correct frequency) and valid Rule 3 uses (that are not Rule 4 forbidden), are there ANY other numbers remaining in your identified list from Phase 1?\n   - If yes, these are EXTRANEOUS and a VIOLATION.\n\n**RULE 6 (Prior Result Handling - Conceptual Names):**\n   - Refer to Rule 6 in the Generator's Writing Guide (if present).\n   - If prior results are mentioned, are they referred to by their conceptual names (e.g., 'The Mist-Pearl') and NOT their numerical values?\n\n**Phase 3: Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nBased on your findings from Phase 1 & 2:\n\n-   **`is_valid` (boolean):** True ONLY IF all rules (1.A with exact frequencies, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) from the Generator's Writing Guide are perfectly met.

The central items of interest are the 'Sky-gems'.\nEnvision your characters evaluating several different amounts or examples of 'Sky-gems'. These could be new discoveries (detailed by ALL the numbers with their frequencies: 'twenty-five' (25), 'three' (3), 'nine' (9)) or the outcomes of prior activities (known conceptually as 'The Mist-Pearl'). The story should center on them determining or isolating the *largest*, *most potent*, or *most significant* among these.\n  - Remember to refer to prior results (like 'The Mist-Pearl') using ONLY their conceptual names, NOT their underlying numbers.\n  - The new numbers directly involved in this step (with their frequencies) are: 'twenty-five' (25), 'three' (3), 'nine' (9) (ALL must be mentioned with correct counts).\n\nThis preeminent quantity will thereafter be referred to conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'. Do not explicitly state its actual numerical value ('twenty-five').\n\n**Crucial Storytelling Constraint:** Your narrative MUST NOT explicitly state the number 'twenty-five' (25) AS THE RESULT of this operation. Instead, the story should imply this outcome through the characters' actions, discoveries, or the state of the 'Sky-gems', so that 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' becomes the way to think about this new state.\n**Important Narrative Challenge:** The numerical value of this operation's outcome ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of the numbers you need to mention as an input (with its specific frequency). Your story must carefully distinguish its role. Mention 'twenty-five' (25) when describing the initial items/quantities (as per Rule 1, with correct frequency). However, when describing the *result* of the operation, you must only imply it conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' and NOT restate 'twenty-five' as the outcome (as per Rule 2).\n\nRemember, all numbers that ARE explicitly mentioned (only those listed in Rule 1 of your Writing Guide, with their exact frequencies) must be written as words (e.g., 'seven' not '7').\n\n**Narrative Challenge & Your Writing Guide for This Scene (CRITICAL: Adhere Flawlessly. Failure to meet these numerical rules, especially exact frequencies in Rule 1.A, will result in rejection.):**\nYour main goal is to weave a compelling scene. However, for this specific task, you must precisely control how numbers are mentioned, turning constraints into creative storytelling:\n\n**1. Key Details to Feature (Numbers in Action & Their EXACT Frequencies):**\n    **A. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE (CRITICAL & MANDATORY: MENTION EACH NUMBER EXACTLY THE SPECIFIED TIMES. NO MORE, NO LESS. EACH MENTION MUST BE A DISTINCT NARRATIVE ELEMENT REPRESENTING AN INPUT TO THIS OPERATION.):**\n- 'three' (3): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'nine' (9): exactly one (1) time(s)\n- 'twenty-five' (25): exactly one (1) time(s)\nEnsure each number above appears in the narrative precisely that many times as a direct input for this operation.\n\n\n    **B. Detailed Explanation & Examples for Rule 1 (Adherence is Paramount):**\n    Your narrative MUST introduce quantities of the central item ('Sky-gems') corresponding to EACH number listed in the Summary (1.A) above. Each number MUST be mentioned EXACTLY the number of times specified. \n    *   **How to Count Mentions (Crucial for Correctness):** Each mention must correspond to a distinct group, instance, or observation of items being introduced as a direct input for THIS scene's operation. If a number (e.g., 'seven') is required multiple times by Rule 1.A (e.g., 'seven' is required two times), you MUST narrate **two separate and distinct narrative events of discovering or observing 'seven Sky-gems'**. For example: 'First, they located seven Sky-gems in a hidden compartment. Later, after further searching, a second, separate cache revealed another seven Sky-gems.' Do not try to group these into a single statement like 'they found two groups of seven Sky-gemss' as this might be miscounted.\n        - If 'one' is required twice by Rule 1.A: You might narrate, 'She found a single Sky-gems in an alcove. Later, exploring a different passage, another lone Sky-gems was discovered.' This counts as two distinct mentions of 'one' fulfilling Rule 1.A.\n        - Contrast: Saying 'She found two single Sky-gemss' would likely count as one mention of 'two' (if 'two' was required by Rule 1.A) and might NOT correctly fulfill two required mentions of 'one' for Rule 1.A. Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'three' (3) and 'nine' (9) and 'twenty-five' (25). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-five' (25) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-five' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-five' or the digit '25' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sovereign Sky-Gem.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sovereign Sky-Gem represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'twenty-five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'four' (4) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the four groups were examined').\n        *   **CRITICAL: No General Phrasing with 'one', 'two', or 'three':** For this specific scene, the numbers 'one', 'two', and 'three' are ALL either required by Rule 1.A (their use is dedicated to fulfilling those input counts) or are forbidden by Rule 4. Therefore, 'one', 'two', and 'three' CANNOT be used for any additional general narrative phrasing in this scene.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Mist-Pearl'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n\n\n\n**MANDATORY PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST & MENTAL WALKTHROUGH (DO THIS BEFORE GENERATING TEXT - YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IT):**\nBefore you write a single word of the narrative, meticulously review your plan against these critical points. This is not optional.\n\n**1. Rule 1.A - Exact Frequencies - DETAILED PLAN:**\n    *   **Identify ALL Required Numbers & Frequencies:** Look at the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES FOR THIS SCENE' (Rule 1.A in your Writing Guide above). List each number and its exact required count.\n    *   **Plan Each Distinct Mention:** For EACH number and EACH required instance of it (e.g., if 'seven' is needed 2 times, plan 2 separate narrative events for 'seven {safe_primary_object_for_fstring}'), mentally outline a *specific, distinct narrative event, discovery, or observation* where this number will be mentioned as a direct input to THIS operation. **Each of these planned mentions must be a unique piece of storytelling, not just a verbal repetition or a grouped statement.**\n        *   Example: If 'one' is required 2 times by Rule 1.A for 'Sky-gems':\n            *   Plan for Mention 1 of 'one': e.g., 'A single Sky-gems was found under the arch.' (This is one distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n            *   Plan for Mention 2 of 'one': e.g., 'Later, another lone Sky-gems was spotted near the fountain.' (This is a second, separate distinct narrative element for a Rule 1.A input).\n    *   **Confirm Full Coverage & No Phrasing Confusion:** Have you planned a distinct narrative mention for *every single required instance* from Rule 1.A? Are these mentions clearly direct inputs and NOT general phrasing uses (unless Rule 3 explicitly allows it for numbers NOT covered by Rule 1.A or Rule 4)?\n\n**2. Rule 1.B - NO Numerical Summaries/Re-listing:**\n    *   Am I absolutely certain that my narrative will NOT contain any sentences or phrases that re-list, summarize, or total up the numbers I've just introduced as inputs? (e.g., AVOID: 'So, she had found one, then another one, and also five items...'). This is a critical error.\n\n**3. Rule 2 - Implicit Outcome:**\n    *   Is the numerical result of THIS scene's operation (e.g., the sum, the minimum, the median value itself) kept entirely IMPLICIT and NOT stated numerically in the narrative?\n\n**4. Rule 3 & 4 - Permitted vs. Forbidden Numbers (CRITICAL CHECK for 'one', 'two', 'three'):**\n    *   **Review Rule 3 and Rule 4 in your Writing Guide CAREFULLY, especially the new detailed clarifications regarding 'one', 'two', 'three'.**\n    *   If I am considering using 'one', 'two', or 'three' for general phrasing (Rule 3), I must first confirm:\n        a) Is this number ALREADY being used to fulfill a Rule 1.A requirement? If yes, IT CANNOT also be used for general phrasing in this scene.\n        b) Is this number listed as FORBIDDEN in Rule 4? If yes, I CANNOT use it AT ALL.\n        c) Only if it's NOT needed for Rule 1.A AND NOT forbidden by Rule 4, is its use for phrasing genuinely essential and extremely sparing?\n\n**5. Rule 5 - No Other Numbers:**\n    *   Have I ensured NO other numbers, counts, or extraneous figures will appear beyond what's strictly allowed by Rule 1.A (with exact frequencies) and Rule 3 (and not forbidden by Rule 4)?\n\n**6. Rule 3 - Minimalist Approach to Flourishes:**\n    *   Am I only using numbers for Rule 3 (phrasing/arity count) if it's *absolutely unavoidable* for narrative flow AND explicitly permitted by the narrow conditions of Rule 3 for this beat? My default should be to AVOID any Rule 3 numbers unless critically necessary and clearly allowed.\n\n**Only after you have mentally confirmed 'YES' to all applicable checklist items (1-6) and have a clear plan for Rule 1.A, and have specifically double-checked the handling of 'one', 'two', 'three' against Rules 1.A, 3, and 4, should you proceed to write the narrative. Your primary goal is flawless adherence to these numerical rules within a coherent story.**\n\n**Continue From (End of last scene):**\n\"...The descent continued, a slow, steady surrender to the mountain's embrace.

Be explicit and distinct for each required instance.\n    *   **ABSOLUTELY AVOID NUMERICAL SUMMARIES OR RE-LISTING (CRITICAL ERROR SOURCE):** After narrating the discovery or presence of items corresponding to the required numbers in Rule 1.A, **DO NOT ADD ANY SENTENCE OR PHRASE THAT RE-LISTS, RECAPS, OR SUMMARIZES THESE NUMBERS.** For example, if you've described finding 'one item' and then 'five items', DO NOT follow with 'So, they had found one and five items.' The initial narrative descriptions ARE the mentions. Any re-listing will cause a validation failure due to over-counting or misinterpretation. This is a very common mistake; be vigilant.\n    *   **Example of Correct Frequency:** If the Summary (1.A) states \"'- 'five' (-994): exactly two (2) time(s)\", your narrative must contain the word 'five' exactly twice, each time referring to a distinct set of five Sky-gemss relevant to this scene's operation. Do not mention 'five' a third time, even in a summary.\n    The following list details the specific numbers and their word forms that are the direct atomic inputs for this scene's operation: 'three' (3) and 'nine' (9) and 'twenty-five' (25). Ensure your narrative reflects these inputs according to the frequency summary in 1.A.\n\n**2.  The Unspoken Outcome (ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS):** The numerical result of THIS operation (largest value) -- which is 'twenty-five' (25) -- MUST NOT be explicitly stated in the text. It must only be implied by events. This implied result will be known conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem' for future steps.\n    **VERY IMPORTANT & TRICKY SCENARIO FOR THIS BEAT (Result is also an Input):**\n    The numerical result of this operation ('twenty-five') is ALSO one of your required atomic inputs from Rule 1.A. Specifically, 'twenty-five' is required 1 time(s) as a direct input to this operation.\n    **Your Task - Execute Both Parts Flawlessly:**\n        1.  **Fulfill Rule 1.A (Input Requirement):** You MUST narrate 1 distinct instance(s) of 'twenty-five Sky-gems' (or a clear narrative equivalent) being present as direct inputs for this scene's operation. Each of these 1 mentions is for an *input*.\n        2.  **Fulfill Rule 2 (Implicit Outcome Requirement):** After describing all inputs, your narrative must imply that an item/concept representing the value 'twenty-five' is the outcome (i.e., the largest item/group). HOWEVER, when describing this outcome or identifying 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem', you MUST NOT use the word 'twenty-five' or the digit '25' again *in the context of stating or identifying the result*. The outcome must be purely conceptual.\n    *   **Think of it this way:** You introduce 'twenty-five Sky-gems' 1 times as *ingredients*. Then, the *final dish* (conceptually 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem') happens to have a characteristic that corresponds to the value 'twenty-five', but you don't name that characteristic with the number word again.\n    *   **Illustrative Example (Adapt to YOUR operation - MAX - and numbers):\n**        Suppose for a different problem, the inputs included 'two items' (required twice for Rule 1.A) and 'five items', and the operation was to find the smallest (MIN), making 'two' the result.\n        - Correct for Rule 1.A: '...they found two relics here. Later, they uncovered another two relics. They also found five relics elsewhere.' (Two mentions of 'two' as inputs, one of 'five').\n        - Correct for Rule 2 (implying 'two' is the MIN result): '...of all the caches, the one containing the first pair of relics was clearly the least significant, and they designated it The Sovereign Sky-Gem.' (Implies the 'two relics' group is the MIN without saying 'the minimum is two').\n        - Incorrect for Rule 2: '...the minimum was two relics.' OR '...The Sovereign Sky-Gem represented two.'\n    This demands extremely careful phrasing. Your 1 mention(s) of 'twenty-five' are for INPUTS ONLY. The RESULT is implied via 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n\n\n**3.  Permitted Narrative Flourishes (Read VERY Carefully - Extremely Strict Limits Apply):\n**    You MAY use the number 'four' (4) ONLY if it is genuinely and clearly used to state the count of direct items/groups involved in THIS specific action (e.g., 'the four groups were examined').\n        *   **CRITICAL: No General Phrasing with 'one', 'two', or 'three':** For this specific scene, the numbers 'one', 'two', and 'three' are ALL either required by Rule 1.A (their use is dedicated to fulfilling those input counts) or are forbidden by Rule 4. Therefore, 'one', 'two', and 'three' CANNOT be used for any additional general narrative phrasing in this scene.\n    All uses under Rule 3 must be EXTREMELY sparing (ideally avoided), verifiably essential for fluency, not confused with Rule 1.A inputs, and NOT be a number listed as forbidden in Rule 4 (Rule 4 always takes precedence).\n\n**4.  Whispers Best Left Unheard (ABSOLUTELY Forbidden Numbers for THIS SCENE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Strictly AVOID MENTIONING these specific numbers in ANY FORM (word or digit): 'one' (1), 'two' (2), 'five' (5), 'six' (6), 'seven' (7), 'ten' (10), 'eleven' (11), 'twelve' (12), 'thirteen' (13), 'fifteen' (15), 'sixteen' (16), 'seventeen' (17), 'eighteen' (18), 'nineteen' (19), 'twenty' (20), 'twenty-one' (21), 'twenty-three' (23), 'twenty-four' (24), 'twenty-six' (26), 'twenty-seven' (27), 'twenty-eight' (28), 'thirty' (30), 'one hundred sixteen' (116). This rule OVERRIDES Rule 3 if there's a conflict. If a number is on this forbidden list, it cannot be used, period.\n\n**5.  The Rule of No Other Numbers (CRITICAL & ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS):\n**    Do not introduce any other numerical values (digits or words) beyond those explicitly covered by rules 1-4 above. No intermediate sums or calculations should be shown. Any number not explicitly justified by Rule 1.A (with exact frequency) or Rule 3 (and not overridden by Rule 4) is an error.\n\n6.  **Echoes of the Past (Referring to Prior Results):** If your characters refer to the outcome of a previous significant event (which we've named, for example, 'The Mist-Pearl'), you MUST use these evocative names. Think of them as legendary items or well-known past results. The actual number these names represent should remain a secret from the reader, hinted at only by their conceptual name.\nFocus on clear storytelling that naturally implies the calculations based on these strict numerical constraints. The most common errors are failing to meet exact frequencies for Rule 1.A, re-stating numbers (numerical summaries), or using numbers not explicitly permitted by these rules. Pay special attention to the interaction between Rule 1.A, Rule 3, and Rule 4 for numbers like 'one', 'two', and 'three'. Double-check your work against ALL rules, especially 1.A, before finalizing your scene.\n---\n\n**VALIDATION ALGORITHM - FOLLOW EXACTLY, using the Generator's Writing Guide above as the source of truth for allowed/forbidden numbers and their usage for THIS beat:**\n\n**Phase 1: Number Identification & Initial Counting**\n1.  Read the 'Generated Beat Text' carefully.\n2.  Identify EVERY number mentioned, whether as a digit (e.g., \"7\") or a word (e.g., \"seven\").\n3.  For EACH distinct number found, count its total frequency of appearance in the text.\n    *Example: If \"one\" appears 3 times and \"five\" appears 1 time, your internal count is {'one': 3, 'five': 1}.*\n\n**Phase 2: Rule-by-Rule Compliance Check**\n\n**RULE 1.A (Required Atomic Inputs & EXACT Frequencies):**\n   - Refer to Rule 1.A in the Generator's Writing Guide (specifically the 'SUMMARY OF REQUIRED NUMBER FREQUENCIES').\n   - For EACH number listed there as required:\n     a. Is it present in the text?\n     b. Does its frequency in the text EXACTLY match the required frequency? (e.g., if 'five' is required 2 times, it must appear exactly 2 times, no more, no less).\n   - If any required number is missing OR its frequency is incorrect, this is a VIOLATION.\n   - *Note on Rule 1.B (No Re-listing/Summaries):* If you detect a sentence that seems to summarize or re-list numbers already introduced as inputs (violating Rule 1.B from the Generator's Guide), this often leads to frequency violations for Rule 1.A. Flag this as a likely cause of frequency errors.\n\n**RULE 2 (Outcome Handling - Implicit vs. Explicit):**\n   - Refer to Rule 2 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Is the numerical result of THIS operation (value: 'twenty-five' (25)) explicitly stated in the text?\n   - If it IS stated:\n     a. Is this allowed because the result is ALSO a Rule 1.A input (see context above)?\n     b. If it's stated but NOT a Rule 1.A input, this is a VIOLATION.\n     c. If it IS a Rule 1.A input, ensure its count is handled under Rule 1.A and it's not *additionally* stated as the result. The narrative should imply the result conceptually as 'The Sovereign Sky-Gem'.\n   - If the operation is MEDIAN, the numerical result MUST NEVER be stated.\n\n**RULE 3 (Permitted Narrative Flourishes - Phrasing/Arity):**\n   - Refer to Rule 3 in the Generator's Writing Guide for numbers like 'one', 'two', 'three' and the arity count (4).\n   - For any such number found in the text that is NOT fulfilling a Rule 1.A requirement:\n     a. Is it explicitly permitted by Rule 3 of the Generator's Guide for this specific beat? (The guide might restrict some of these if they are Rule 1.A or Rule 4).\n     b. Is its use genuinely for sparing, essential phrasing or correctly stating the arity, and not just an extraneous mention?\n     c. Is it NOT a number forbidden by Rule 4? (Rule 4 overrides Rule 3).\n   - Any number used under the guise of Rule 3 but violating these conditions is an EXTRANEOUS number.\n\n**RULE 4 (Absolutely Forbidden Numbers):**\n   - Refer to Rule 4 in the Generator's Writing Guide.\n   - Are ANY numbers listed there as forbidden present in the text?
