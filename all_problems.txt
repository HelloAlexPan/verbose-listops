**Detailed Instructions**
1. Extract numeric directives from narrative.
2. Disregard all compliance logs, mock logs, and boilerplate outside 'Computation Sections'.
3. For `MAX`: take the highest integer.
   For `MIN`: take the lowest integer.
   For `MED`: find the median (lower middle on even counts).
   For `SM`: compute sum modulo 10.
4. Resolve sub-operations before parent operations.

**Detailed Instructions**
1. Extract numeric directives from narrative.
2. Disregard all compliance logs, mock logs, and boilerplate outside 'Computation Sections'.
3. For `MAX`: take the highest integer.
   For `MIN`: take the lowest integer.
   For `MED`: find the median (lower middle on even counts).
   For `SM`: compute sum modulo 10.
4. Resolve sub-operations before parent operations.

**Detailed Instructions**
1. Extract numeric directives from narrative.
2. Disregard all compliance logs, mock logs, and boilerplate outside 'Computation Sections'.
3. For `MAX`: take the highest integer.
   For `MIN`: take the lowest integer.
   For `MED`: find the median (lower middle on even counts).
   For `SM`: compute sum modulo 10.
4. Resolve sub-operations before parent operations.
