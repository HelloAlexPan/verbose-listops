# Verbose ListOps Evaluation Benchmark

**EXPERIMENTAL — WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Overview

Welcome to the Verbose ListOps Evaluation Benchmark repository. This benchmark is designed to assess the reasoning capabilities of sequence models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), when faced with tasks requiring processing of extremely long and verbose contexts.

It builds upon the standard [ListOps benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06028) by transforming its concise, symbolic problem representation into lengthy, narrative-style natural language descriptions.

## The Core ListOps Task

The underlying computational task remains identical to the original ListOps benchmark. Models are required to:

1.  Parse a sequence representing nested operations on lists.
2.  The operations include `MAX` (maximum), `MIN` (minimum), `MED` (median), and `SM` (sum modulo 10).
3.  Operands are single-digit integers (0-9).
4.  Evaluate these nested operations hierarchically.
5.  Produce a single-digit integer as the final result.

ListOps fundamentally tests a model's ability to understand hierarchical structures and perform sequential reasoning.

## Design Goal: Testing Large Context Windows

**The primary motivation behind Verbose ListOps is to rigorously evaluate model performance specifically on tasks involving extremely large context windows.**

Standard benchmarks, while valuable, may not sufficiently stress a model's ability to:

* Maintain coherence and track dependencies over tens of thousands of tokens.
* Extract relevant operational information from highly verbose or noisy text.
* Perform multi-step reasoning when instructions are spread across a vast input sequence.

This benchmark was designed to directly address this gap by inflating the input length dramatically while keeping the core logical task constant, thereby isolating the challenge of long-context processing. Target context lengths for generated problems can reach **50,000 tokens or more**.

## Methodology: Achieving Verbosity

Verbose ListOps problems are generated by transforming standard ListOps sequences (e.g., `[SM 8 [MAX 9 1] 0]`) into detailed natural language narratives. This involves:

1.  **Textual Operators:** Replacing symbolic operators (`MAX`, `MIN`) with descriptive phrases ("find the maximum value", "determine the smallest number").
2.  **Textual Operands:** Representing digits as words ("eight") or embedded descriptions ("the integer 1").
3.  **Narrative Structure:** Using sentences, paragraphs, and explicit sectioning (e.g., "Part 1", "Section A.1") to define list structures and nesting instead of brackets `[]`.
4.  **Massive Filler Injection:** Programmatically inserting large volumes of irrelevant or semi-relevant text between meaningful instructions. This filler is the key mechanism for achieving extreme context lengths and includes:
    * Procedural boilerplate and fictional compliance notes.
    * Repetitive status updates, timestamps, and logs.
    * Redundant explanations of basic concepts.
    * Excerpts from unrelated texts (e.g., public domain literature).

## Why Verbose ListOps?

As LLMs achieve longer nominal context windows (100k, 1M+ tokens), evaluating their *effective* reasoning capability across these spans becomes crucial. Verbose ListOps provides a challenging test case where the core task is relatively simple, but finding and connecting the necessary information within the vast, noisy context is the primary difficulty. It helps answer: Can models truly *use* their long context for complex reasoning, or do they struggle with distraction and dependency tracking over extended sequences?

## Dataset Structure (Conceptual)

This repository (conceptually) would contain:

* Scripts for generating Verbose ListOps problems from standard ListOps inputs.
* Configuration files to control verbosity levels and target token lengths.
* A dataset of pre-generated problems, potentially structured as:
    * `problem_id`: Unique identifier.
    * `standard_listops`: The original concise ListOps string.
    * `verbose_listops`: The full, lengthy natural language problem text.
    * `answer`: The correct single-digit result (0-9).

## Usage

1.  **Generate/Select Problems:** Use the provided scripts or select pre-generated problems from the dataset.
2.  **Model Input:** Feed the `verbose_listops` text directly to the language model being evaluated.
3.  **Model Output:** Parse the model's response to extract the predicted single-digit answer.
4.  **Evaluation:** Compare the model's prediction against the ground truth `answer`. Calculate accuracy or other relevant metrics.

## Example Snippet

To illustrate the transformation:

**Standard ListOps**: [SM 8 1 4 [MAX 9 2 7]]

**Verbose ListOps:**
*Section A. Introduction & Compliance Notice*
In accordance with the Procedural Arithmetic Compliance Manual (Edition 4, Revision B), this document—hereafter referred to as the “evaluation specification”—outlines a multi‐stage computation task.  You are asked to interpret narrative instructions and perform fundamentally a “sum modulo ten” operation on a primary list of numerical elements.  For audit purposes, please note all section headings, repeated explanatory remarks, and compliance boilerplate.

*Section B. Primary List Definition*
	1.	First element: the integer eight (8).
	2.	Second element: the integer one (1).
	3.	Third element: the integer four (4).
	4.	Fourth element: a nested list.

*Section C. Nested List Instructions*
Within the nested list, you will locate three individual integers—nine (9), two (2), and seven (7)—and you will “determine the maximum value among these three integers,” per the operator directive.  Please ignore all subsequent filler paragraphs outside of numeric context (e.g., “This paragraph exists for verbosity but does not alter the data.”).

*Section D. Computation & Result Requirement*
Once you have (a) identified the maximum among 9, 2, 7; (b) appended that result to the primary list; and (c) summed all four elements; you shall then “compute the sum modulo ten” and report the resulting single‐digit integer.  All compliance logs, timestamp entries, and fictional legal disclaimers in this narrative can be disregarded in your final numerical reasoning.

**Answer:** 2
(Since max(9, 2, 7)=9; sum = 8+1+4+9=22; 22 mod 10=2.)
